<h3>1.0 Introduction</h3>
The number of bulletins issued since the first
volume of the music catalogue was published having
become cumbersome, it has been thought, for
the convenience of our customers, best to issue another
volume. This second volume is arranged
alphabetically by composers, with an index at the
back of the book, including prices of all rolls listed.
Biographical sketches not contained in Volume I
are included in these pages and the compositions
arranged since the last bulletin was printed, some
twenty-five in number, are included in this edition
and will not appear in bulletins.
<h3>2.0 CATALOGUE OF MUSIC VOLUME II</h3>
<h3>ALBERT, L.</h3>
<h4>448 Cherry</h4>
Here is a sparkling bit of melody which we have
put on a roll for dance purposes. It is entirely
satisfactory as a musical number also, but its
strongest appeal is to those who dance. It is
very popular as a one-step and is enjoying a
degree of popularity.
<h3>ANDREWS, Mark 1875-</h3>
This noted organist was born in Gainsborough. England
in 1875, and came to the Umted States in 19002,
since which time he has resided in Montclair, N. J.
He is one of the best-known organists in the New
York district, and as a composer stands high, having
published over one hwndred works, including two
sonatas for organ. He is organist at the First Congregational
Church, Montclair.
<h4>455 Venetian Idyl</h4>
This is in effect a delightful little barcarole or
boat song. It has the graceful rhythm of the
barcarole form and is charming in both melody
and harmony.
<h4>478 Serenade</h4>
"Serenade" is a very indefinite term as applied
to a musical composition. Therefore, like most
other titles, its principal use is as a means of
identification. No designation could add to, or
detract from, the innate beauty of this little
thing. As in all the work of this composer, this
serenade reveals a remarkable gift of melody,
and as the harmonic setting is highly appropriate,
the result could be nought but enjoyable.
It is a little gem.
<h3>ARENSKY, Anton Stepanovitch 1861-1906</h3>
This well-known Russian composer and pianist was
born at Novgorod, July 31, 1861, and died in a sanatorium
at Tarioki, Finland, February 26, 1906, after
a long illness. He was a pupil of Johanssen and
Rimsky-Korsakow and in, 1882 was appointed Professor
of Harmony and Composition at the Imperial
Conservatory at Moscow. In 1895 he became conductor
of the Imperial Court Choir at Petrograd.
Arensky's muse was lyrical rather than dramatic, and
his smller numbers for the piano are particularly
delightful. suggesting Tchaikowsky. His works include
operas and most of the larger forms. 
<h4>523 Romance</h4>
This is a fair sample of the lyric quality of this
composer. He was much at home in things
such as this-and what could be prettier! It is
melodious and poetic in the extreme. The
harmonies are characteristic of the Russian
school and need no further recommendation.
<h3>ATHERTON, F.</h3>
<h4>416 Reverie</h4>
It is fortunate that so many things originally
written for the piano are satisfactorily adaptable
to the organ. Verily, the true greatness of
the pipe organ is found in ability to do all things
well.
<p>
In the case of hand-playing this trait of the
organ is limited to the technical ability of the
performer. The roll, however, recognizes no
such limitations, and it seems to delight in the
perforrpance of the most startling technical
difficulties. All this, however, is by the way.
The present number is a fugitive conceit for the
piano which loses none of its charm as a result of
its adaptation to the organ, and will be a pleasure
to all who hear it.
<h3>BACH, Johann Sebastian</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>647 Fantasie and Fugue in G Minor</h4>
Of all the Bach fugues for organ, this is the 

greatest. It is known as the "Great G Minor." 

It is wonderful when first heard, and grows 

more wonderful with each successive hearing. 

It should be listened to with the greatest attention.
Its depths of beauty are not to be fathomed
by the casual listener. It must be studied, 

as is an antique work of art.
<p> 

The fantasie, which is really an introduction, is a 

gigantic recitative,-like the oration of a Cicero 

or Socrates. It is Bach with a free rein. Those 

who are accustomed to think of Bach as conventional
will do well to give particular attention to 

this fantasie.
<p> 

It serves its purpose well in preparing the mind 

for the wonderful fugue which follows. 

<h4>663 Gavotte, from the Sixth Violin Sonata</h4>
This is a very famous gavotte from the last of
Bach's six sonatas for the violin. What charming
dance music it is! It is as dignified as a
minuet, but much more sprightly and vivacious.
With the minuet it divides honors as the most
charming of the old dance forms. No finer
example of this fascinating form exists than this
one.
<h3>BAGLEY, E. E.</h3>
<h4>371 National Emblem March</h4>
This is a stirring march, which through sheer
merit has won its way into popular favor. The
organ does full justice to its martial swing, and
falls little short of the effect produced by a
military band.
<h3>BALL, Ernest R. 1878-</h3>
This composer-sometimes called the "American
Tosti"--was born in Cleveland, July 21, 1878. He
was educated at the Cleveland Conservatory, and has
written more real successes than any other American
composer. Some of his most popular hits were "Love
Me and the World Is Mine," "In the Garden of My
Heart," "A Little Bit of Heaven," "Mother Machree,"
etc.
<h4>558 Down the Trail to Home, Sweet Home</h4>
This is a very popular waltz song which we have
arranged on the roll for dance purposes. It
fulfills its mission ideally. 
<h3>BARON, Maurice</h3>
<h4>549 An Indian Legend</h4>
Here is a really charming number which has in
it enough of exotic flavor to justify the title.
Four seemingly indefinite measures introduce a
beautiful theme which flows along gracefully for
a few measures when the introductory measures
appear as a counterpoint to the main theme.
The middle part is in splendid contrast, and
rises to a stirring climax. The:first theme then
reappears with a delightful flute obligato, leaving
the last word for the solo violin.
<h3>BARTHELMY, R.</h3>
<h4>555 Caressing Butterfly</h4>
This is a very pretty ballad-like melody with
just enough accompaniment to support it.
There is ample opportunity for the use of various
solo stops, and this opportunity has not been
overlooked in the arrangement. It is the sort of
thing that sounds best when all is quiet and the
lights are dim, and when one is in a meditative
mood.
<h3>BARTLETT, Homer Newton 1845-1910</h3>
Homer N. Bartlett was one of the best-known and
ablest of American composers. He was born in Olive,
N. Y., December 28, 1845, and soon showed unmistakable
evidence of great musical talent. He studied
piano with S. B. Mills, Max Braun and others until
1861. He played the organ in a number of New
York churches, his last position as organist being at
the Madison Avenue Baptist Church, where he played
for thirty-one years. He died on April 2, 192O. In
every sense he was an American-made musician. He
left behind many published works of worth, which
include nearly all of the orthodox forms, and a goodly
number in manuscript which the public will be interested
in hearing. The latter include a three act opera,
"La Valliere:' an oratorio, "Samuel," and a symphonic
poem, "Apollo."
<h4>484 Meditation Serieuse</h4>
This is one of the best-known and most pretentious
of Bartlett's compositions for organ.
While it is a little reminiscent of Wagner, it is
nevertheless a delightfully original composition
and brimful of innate beauty. It contains some
very striking harmonic progressions, and is no
less interesting melodically. It reveals the sterling
musicianship of the composer, and is a
splendid composition in every sense.
<h3>BATISTE, Edouard</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>660 Larghetto in E flat</h4>
Batiste wrote many things such as this, and they
are all worthy a hearing. He had a wonderful
gift of melody which he always supported by
appropriate and attractive harmonies. Here we
have a simple and pretty theme voiced in the
first instance with a simple accompaniment.
On the second appearance of the theme, after a
short interlude, we find it treated with a florid
accompaniment. Here we find Batiste doing
the sort of thing he liked best to do. It is a
really delightful little thing and characteristic
of the composer.
<h3>BEETHOVEN, Ludwig van</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>387 Symphony No. 5 in C Minor Allegro con Brio-First Movement</h4>
Of all classic symphonies, this is the one which
is most often played. The first movement is famous
for the brevity of its first and principal
theme, which consists of the first four notes
heard-three short and a long one. What can
be said about this theme that is new!
The music lover is familiar with the various
theories concerning it, any or all of which are
correct or erroneous, according to point of view.
After all, what is the use of all the talk about
what music means! The very tune which would
provoke a feeling of sadness in one would move
another to mirth, and to still another be whimsical,
capricious, or bizarre.
Beethoven himself said of his Pastoral Symphony-his
only attempt at symphonic programme music-that it
was "rather an expression
of feeling than a picture." Incidentally he
failed to state what feeling it expressed.
This wonderful music has a story for all; let it tell it.
<h4>388 Symphony No.5 in C Minor Third (Scherzo) and Fourth (A1legro) Movements</h4>
To most people this Scherzo seems to open with
an interrogation-which meets with an immediate
reply. As though the answer were unsatisfactory,
the query is repeated but meets with
the same response.
<p>
Then begins one of the most charming musical
conversations extant. What it is about must
be left to the listener. One may find much of
interest concerning this Symphony and others
in Philip H. Goepp's work, "Symphonies and
Their Meaning," to which sterling work we
would recommend all who are interested in
musical matters.
<p>
The present roll contains also the Finale of the
Symphony, giving it without pause as was the
intention of the composer.
<p> 

The last movement is an exultant march of 

gigantic proportions, interrupted by a short 

reference to the Scherzo, after which the March 

theme again takes the reins. At the close of the 

movement, the pace quickens into a Presto and 

the triumphant conclusion is at hand. 

<h4>400 Symphony No.6, Op.68 (Pastoral)</h4>
The Pastoral Symphony was written in the
wooded meadows near Vienna in the summer of
1808. Beethoven's inscription on the score may
be translated as follows, "The pleasant, cheerful
feelings which arise in man on arriving in
the country." He also adds that it is more an
expression of feeling than a painting.
There is, in the British Museum, a book of
sketches concerning this Symphony in Beethoven's
own hand, and in them he says that "The 

hearer is to be allowed to find out the situations 

for himself."
<p>
This would seem to indicate that Beethoven was 

very skeptical as to the power of music to engender
definite impressions, a fact in keeping 

with his general good sense with regard to music 

matters. The music is delightful and satisfying,
and it matters little what it means. 

<h4>411 Scherzo-Andante Scherzoso from String Quartette" Op. 18, No.4</h4>
Here is Beethoven in a playful humor! To 

many this statement may seem incompatible 

with the generally accepted idea of Beethoven's 

character. As a matter of fact, Beethoven had 

a sense of humor such as was possessed by few 

of the great composers.
<p> 

He was, perhaps, excelled in this particular by 

no one except Haydn. Surely he needed something
to balance the serious side of his life. 

This number is one of the brightest gems of 

musical composition. It has definite form; 

melody in profusion; and harmonies so simple, 

quaint and appropriate as to give the impression
that no other harmonies could be possible.
It is one of the most spontaneous, effervescent
and exuberant examples of writing extant.
<h4>412 Allegro from String Quartette, Op. 18, No.5</h4>
The combination of two violins, viola and 'cello
has furnished a vehicle for the sublimest inspirations
of most of the classical composers. The
form, as we know it, was originated by Haydn,
and is nothing more nor less than the sonata or
symphony form applied to four-part writing.
The early quartettes of Haydn were feeble and
immature things, but the child of Haydn's mind
grew to manhood and he ,left many quartettes
which are today'standards. Mozart bridged the
gap to Beethoven and left behind him twentysix
immortal quartettes.
<p>
Beethoven, unlike some of the others, seemed to
experience no handicap in having to write for
only four fiddles, instead of a full orchestra, and
his quartettes are just as symphonic as though
they had been called sympnonies, the only difference
being that in one case he wrote a
symphony for a quartette of strings, and in the
other for a full orchestra.
<p>
The present roll is the first movement of the
celebrated quartette in A major, and is an
example of Beethoven in his cheeriest mood. It
is full of interesting dialogue, and there is not a
dull moment in it.
<h4>427 Allegro ma non tanto, Op. 18, No. 4</h4>
The Number 4 Quartette is perhaps the best
known of the six contained in Opus 18, and indeed
is a general favorite among the earlier
quartettes. While the present movement is
purely orthodox from a Beethoven point of
view, being in the sonata form invented by
Beethoven and used by him and all other composers
since, it is not so elaborate as many of the
later opera in quartette form. It is no less
charming, howev~r, on account of its comparative
simplicity.
<h4>433 Adagio from Moonlight Sonata, Op. 27, No.2</h4>
Beethoven did nothing in the way of piano compositions
that is more widely known or more
passionately loved than the so-called Moonlight
Sonata. Nothing could be more beautiful than
the plaintive, soul-stirring theme of this movement.
<p>
The silly name which it bears is derived from a
criticism of the sonata by Rellstab which mentioned
the moonlight on the Lake of Lucerne.
It might just as appropriately bear any other
title. It is a work of superlative beauty and
needs no sobriquet to arouse interest or stimulate
imagination.
<h4>435 Minuetto, Op. 18, No. 4</h4>
What more need be said of this roll than that
it is taken from a Beethoven string quartette?
Such a minuet could not have been written by
anyone else. Beethoven was always Beethoven!
His earliest compositions resembled those of
no other composer except in form. His remarkable
naivete and ingenuousness were his chief
characteristics through life. Any movement
from a Beethoven quartette is a "thing of
beauty and a joy forever."
<h4>526 Allegretto alia Polacca</h4>
This is not only "like a Polacca" but it is a Polacca.
It is from the delightful Serenade, Op. 8,
for Violin, Viola and Violoncello. This whole
trio bears the stamp of youthful enthusiasm and
is one of the most fascinating things Beethoven
did in early life. That Beethoven liked it in his
after years-although he cared little for his
early work-is proven by the fact that he arranged
this serenade for piano and violin and
called it Notturno, Op. 42. Beethoven's facility
in writing for a limited number of instruments
was never better shown than in this, the daintiest
of things. There is no adjective which adequately
defines it,-it must be heard.
<h4>533 Larghetto from Second Symphony</h4>
It is readily discovered by students of Beethoven
that his music may be divided into periods.
That is to say, certain characteristics are present
in many of his works which seem to place them
naturally into a group. Nothing was too good
for Beethoven, and he very wisely began his
career as a composer with Haydn and Mozart
as his models. They represented the best in
music, and it was natural that the youthful
genius of Beethoven should aim high.
<p>
Before long, however, he felt a certain restraint
in the use of the strict forms employed by
Haydn and Mozart, and he began to leave the
beaten path and start out for himself, refusing
to be dictated to by anybody or anything except
that rare thing within him which we call 
genius. The noted student and writer, Herr
von Lenz, places the Second Symphony, Op. 36,
in the first period, and, singularly enough, be
places Op. 26, Op. 27 and Op. 31-which were
written at least a year earlier than Op. 36-in
the second period. It is evident, therefore, that
chronology plays little part in the arrangement
of the learned writer. It would seem that Beethoven
at times felt a little strange and lonely
while exploring, and returned temporarily to
the familiar paths of the past. But it was only
temporary, for his progress was inevitable.
<p>
The Larghetto from the Second Symphony is
as strongly characteristic of Beethoven as anything
he did later in life. It may lack some of
the finesse of his later works, but the divine
spark illumines it from beginning to end. It is
superlatively beautiful.
<h4>557 Scherzo from Second Symphony</h4>
This Scherzo is in the form invented by Beethoven,
and used by him in most of his symphonies.
It is a youthful Beethoven that speaks,
but it is as characteristic of him as anything
achieved later in life. No one else could have
done it.
<h4>575 Adagio Molto, from First Symphony</h4>
This is the first movement of Beethoven's First
Symphony. Aside from its native beauty and
great musical worth, it is interesting to note how
thoroughly characteristic of the mature Beethoven
it is. It is a perfectly easy matter to
place the works of Beethoven into periods, and
it has been done. In other words, his progress
in the technique of composition is not only discoverable,
but obvious. He was a master from
the beginning. His works are individual to a
greater extent than those of any other composer.
Anyone familiar with his works would
easily discover, upon hearing this first symphony,
the composer of the ninth, or of any of
the others. The touch of the master is ever
present. This movement is much less involved
than some of the later works, but is just as
charming as anything can be.
<h4>579 Allegretto, Second Movement, Seventh Symphony</h4>
The Seventh Symphony has been called the
"Poem of Earth and Humanity"-a rather
high-sounding title, but perhaps as good as any
-certain as it is that it is Beethoven in a rare
vein. The first theme is dirgelike. in its rhythm
and harmonies. The second melody is in the
major and abandons the solemn vein. It is a
lyrical gem. Both themes seem strangely
prophetic of Schubert. A period of contrapuntal
and fugal development brings on again
the mournful first theme which sings itself to a
peaceful end, and with the end of this allegretto
comes the end of one of the greatest compositions
in music literature.
<h4>583 Gavotte in F Major</h4>
We have put this little piece on the organ as
much for its historical interest as for any other
reason. It lacks none of the essentials of a fine
gavotte, but its greatest interest lies in the fact
that it is a recently discovered effort of Beethoven's
youth-sixteen years of age. We give
the history of it, quoting Harold Bauer:
"The present edition of an unpublished gavotte
by Beethoven is due to investigations made in
1908 by Messrs. Georges de St. Foix and
Theodore de Wyzewa with the object of establishing
the authenticity of certain autograph
manuscripts heretofore attributed to Mozart.
"These manuscripts, originally in the possession
of the Emperor of Austria, were presented by
him, oddly enough, to no less a person than
the Sultan Abdul-Aziz of Turkey, who subsequently
gave them to his music director, Guatelli
Pasha. The well-known English collector,
Julian Marshall, bought them from Guatelli's
son and they were ultimately acquired by the
British Museum.
<p>
"A close examination of these manuscripts resulted
in the startling conclusion that not only
had a serious error been committed in attributing
them to Mozart, but that the idiosyncrasies
of style and handwriting proved beyond the possibility
of doubt that they could have emanated
from no other pen than that of Beethoven.
<p>
"This charming gavotte, which represents Beethoven
in his earliest and consequently most
Mozartian period (about 1786), was played for
the first time by Mme. Olga Samaroff and the
editor at a concert given by the Beethoven Association
on January 13, 1920, in New York."
<h4>631 Tempo Ordinario d' un Minuetto</h4>
This is an adaptation of the wonderful minuet
from the Serenade for Flute, Violin, and Viola,
Op. 25. No other composer ever approached
Beethoven in his ability to write for a small 
number of instruments. In this line he had no
competitor. This minuet is rather unique in
form in that it has two trios, after each of which
the first two strains are played. Itis Beethoven
at his best. Nothing more daintily beautiful
was ever conceived.
<h4>641 Adagio Cantabile from Septet, Op.20</h4>
We have from time to time remarked in these
pages that nothing could be more exquisite than
a Beethoven slow movement. That assertion
still stands, and we now offer more evidence as
to its truthfulness.
<p>
This famous composition, which is nothing more
nor less than a symphony for seven instruments,
was written for violin, viola, 'cello, double bass,
clarinet, bassoon and horn, and dedicated to the
Empress Maria Theresa. In the organ adaptation
we have given strict attention to the original
scoring, with the result that the arrangement
lacks little, if any, of the charm due to the unique
selection of instruments for which it was written.
It is a most exquisite composition faithfully
given by the roll.
<h4>722 Sonata Pathetique, First Movement</h4>
Here we have a movement from one of Beethoven's
early sonatas which lends itself to organ
adaptation in a manner which will surprise those
who believe (or pretend to so believe) that piano
music should be performed on the piano only.
One only has to hear the wonderful introduction
to realize that the piano never could equal the
organ in this particular thing. The title
"Pathetique" is extremely apt. The main body
of this movement is quite equal to the introduction
in effectiveness.
<h4>733 Coriolanus Overture</h4>
Of all the overtures of Beethoven this one to
Coriolanus, a tragedy by Colin, is perhaps the
most popular.
<p>
It is certainly as beautiful as any, and by many
thought to be Beethoven's best work in the
overture form. It was written in 1807. He
was quite as much at home in the overture form
as in the symphony form, and his marvelous
gift of melody, coupled with his wonderful
technique of composition, are just as apparent
here as in the symphony.
<h4>736 Prometheus Overture</h4>
"The Men of Prometheus" is the title of the
ballet of which this is the overture. This overture
and seventeen other numbers comprise the
only ballet that Beethoven wrote. The overture
alone lives by virtue of its value as a concert
number. The entire ballet was performed in
1801 in Vienna, but little if any of the music is
now known except the wonderfully brilliant
overture, which we have very effectively arranged
for the organ, from the orchestral score.
<h4>740 Leonore Overture, No.3</h4>
It is very well known that Beethoven wrote
but one opera. The libretto was adapted by
Joseph Sonnliethner from Bouilly's "Leonore
or l'Amour conjugal." He received the text in
the winter of 1804, and composed the opera at
Hetzendorf in the summer.
<p>
The thing that is of particular interest in connection
with this overture is that he wrote four
overtures to his only opera.
<p>
The opera was first produced at Vienna, on
November 20, 1805, and the overture used was
the one now known as Leonore Overture, No.2.
The libretto was then reduced to two acts, and
three numbers taken from the opera. The above
overture, Leonore No.8, was then composed.
<p>
After the death of the Italian director of the
opera at Prague, and the adoption of German
opera there, Beethoven, in the hope of having
his opera performed by Liebich, the new director,
wrote what we know as Leonore No.1.
<p>
The performance, however, did not take place
and the No. 1 Overture remained in manuscript
until after Beethoven's death.
<p>
The No. 8 Overture is widely known as a concert
number and is a very great favorite.
<h4>742 Egmont Overture</h4>
Beethoven composed this overture for the drama
by Goethe. It is supposed by some commentators
to express the plot of the drama in music.
Beethoven did little in the way of programme
music; his best-known effort being the Pastoral
Symphony, of which he said it was "more an
expression of feeling than of painting." It is
doubtful if the overture is intended to more
than depict certain moods.
<p>
All of this, however, has nothing whatever to do
with the musical worth of this masterpiece. It
needs no programme. It is well able to stand as
a gorgeous composition and needs the support
of no plot, or other extraneous element.
<h3>BERLIN, Irving</h3>
Born in Russia, this composer of popular music came
to America in youth and began composing some of the
lighter pieces. His first hit--one of the first ragtime
songs-was "Alexander's Ragtime Band." He also
composed "Everybody's Doing It" and many other
popular songs.
<h4>559 Tell Me, Little Gypsy</h4>
This is the song hit of Ziegfeld Follies of 1920.
It is arranged as a fox trot, in which form it is
tremendously popular.
<h3>BERLIOZ, Hector 1803-1869</h3>
Berlioz was born at La-Cote-St.-Andre, near Grenoble,
on December 11, 1803. He was the son, of a
country doctor who educated him for the practice of
medicine. We have intimated somewhere in these
paragraphs that a boy who was predestined to become
a musician would overcome any obstacles which were
thrown in his way. The case of Berlioz is additional
proof of our point.
<p>
The most impressionable years of his life were wasted
in the perfunctory study of a profession toward which
(to use his own phrase) he felt nothing better than a
"cold disgust," He finaUy decided upon a musical
career and burned all bridges behind him. His allowance
from home was cut off and he found himself in
such extreme poverty that he was compelled to maintain
himself by singing in a chorus at one of the small
theatres.
<p>
He was admitted as a pupil at the Conservatoire, and
made marvelously rapid progress. He is said to have
lost much, however, by his intractability. He jumped
at conclusions and had little respect for, or paticnce
with, academic methods. After years of disappointment,
he won the Prix de Rome with his cantata, "La
Mort de Sardanapole."
<p>
The terms of the Prix de Rome imposed three years of
travel-the first two to be spent in Italy. He could
not bear expatriation, however, and after eighteen
months he petitioned the Ministry to allow him to return
to Paris, Between 1837 and 1840 he began to
receive recognition. The French Government commissioned
him to write a requicm and paid him a fee
of four thousand francs. In 1834 Paganini paid him
twenty thousand francs for "Harold en Italie." In
1840 he received ten thousand francs for the "Symphonic
Funebre et Triomphale;"
<p>
Most of his works are in the larger forms, consisting
of cantatas, oratorios, symphonies, etc. Among his
literary works, one will hold its place at the top for all
time: his work on orchestration.
<h4>600 Rakoczy March from the Damnation of Faust</h4>
Many are the beliefs as to the origin of this
march, made famous by Berlioz. Its composition
has been attributed to an Austrian prince, 
Rakoczy Ferencz, early in the seventeenth century.
By others it is supposed to have been
composed by Michael Barna, court violinist to
Prince Franz Rakoczy, the second.
<p>
In any event, it was handed down by the gypsies
and Hungarians and put to paper by Carl
Vaczek.
<p>
Berlioz orchestrated it and used it in his
"Damnation of Faust," and, believing in the
eternal fitness of things, transferred the first
scene of the work to Hungary.
<h3>BERNARD, Felix, and BLACK, Johnny S.</h3>
<h4>452 Dardanella</h4>
It is probable that no example of popular writing
has created such a furore as this one in the
same length of time. It is being whistled, sung
and danced by everybody. It is simply impossible
to get away from it. We have produced it
on a roll for dance purposes, and fox-trotting
to its captivating rhythm will be found an enjoyable
pastime.
<h3>BIGGS. Richard Keys 1886-</h3>
This well-known organist was born at Glendale, Ohio,
September 16, 1886. He was educated at the University
of Michigan, studied music at the Cincinnati College
of Music ard in London. His activities, as
organist of one of the large Brooklyn churches, were
interrupted by the war. After receiving his discharge
he returned to Brooklyn and resumed the practice of
his profession. He has made a number of organ
arrangements of operatic and piano compositions, and
a few of his original compositions have been published.
<h4>608 Sunset Meditation</h4>
It is unostentatious, and beautiful in its simplicity-a
pretty melody, delightfully clothed
with the simplest harmonies.
<h3>BIZET, Georges</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>397 L'Arlesienne, First Suite for Orchestra. Minuetto</h4>
The play for which the music was written was a
failure from the first. Bizet, seeming to realize
that it was the text, rather than the music, which
was responsible for the failure, resolved to put
to use some of the good music and selected some
of the best of the numbers, from which he made
two orchestral suites. The First Suite especially
has become a great favorite at orchestra concerts.
The present minuet is one of much grace
and charm, and is delightfully given by the organ.
<h4>409 Farandole from L'Arlesienne</h4>
This is one of the numbers rescued from the ill fated
play by Daudet, for which Bizet composed
the music. As is well known, after the
failure of the play, Bizet got together a few of
the best musical numbers and made them into
two suites. The present number is from the first.
<p>
Little is known as to the origin of the Farandole,
and one cannot do better for a description of it
than to turn to "Grove's Dictionary," from
which we quote the following:
<p>
"The Farandole consists of a long string of young
men and women, sometimes as many as a hundred in
number, holding one another by the hands, or by ribbons
or handkerchiefs. The leader is always a bachelor,
and he is preceded by one or more musicians playing
the galoubet, i.e., a small wooden flute-a-bec, and
the tambourin. With his left hand the leader holds
the hand of his partner, in his right he waves a flag,
handkerchief, or ribbon, which serves as a signal for
his followers. As the Farandole proceeds through 
the streets of the town, the string of dancers is constantly
recruited by fresh additions. The leader (to
quote the poet Mistral) 'makes it come and go, turn
backwards and forwards-sometimes he forms it into
a ring, sometimes winds it in a spiral, then he breaks
off from his followers and dances in front, then he
joins on again, and makes it pass rapidly under the
uplifted arms of the last couple.'"
<p>
The Farandole is usually danced at all the great
feasts in the towns of Provence, such as the
feast of Corpus Domini, or the "Coursos de la
Tarasque," which were founded by King Rene
on April 14, 1474, and take place at Tarascon
annually, on July 29. In the latter the Farandole
is preceded by the huge effigy.of a legendary
monster-the Tarasque-borne by several
men and attended by the gaily dressed chevaliers
de la Tarasque.
<h4>718 Adagietto, Le Carillon, from First L'Arlesienne Suite, No.1</h4>
We have already stated in connection with the
Minuet from this Suite (No. 397), that the
play for which this music was written was a
failure. It is fortunate that Bizet realized the
value of the music and arranged various numbers
into the two suites which are known so well. 
Otherwise we should have been deprived of
some beautiful music.
<p>
Philip Hale, the well-known critic, says of the
Adagietto, "I know of nothing in dramatic
music that approaches this adagio, which not
only accentuates the Biblical sublimity of the
text, but rises to a height of pathos beyond the
reach of word or gesture."
<p>
The Carillon depicts the gaiety of the betrothal
of Frederi and Vivette and the festival of Saint Eloi.
The three incessantly recurring notes
represent bells. The andantino, the middle
part, is the entrance of Mere Renaud, one of
the characters in the play. After this, the Carillon
proceeds to a brilliant end.
<h4>616 Le Retour (The Return)</h4>
Bizet is, of course, chiefly known for his opera
"Carmen." His "Pearl Fishers" is fairly well
known also, as is his Arlesienne Suite. A
simple song without words from his pen, however,
is something hardly to be expected. Here
it is, though, and it is a lovely thing. The orchestras
in some of the large "movie" theatres
have recently discovered its beauty and play it
often. It is likely, therefore, to be recognized
by many who have wondered what it was. The
secret is now out, as a result of this effective roll. 
<h3>BLAUFUSS, Walter</h3>
<h4>453 My Isle of Golden Dreams</h4>
This is a dreamy, quiet waltz which is immensely
popular. It is being played in theatres at times
when soft music is necessary, and is a great
favorite for dance purposes.
<h3>BOELLMANN, Leon 1862-1897</h3>
This famous organist and composer was born in
Ensisheim. Alsace, September 25, 1862, and died in
Paris, October 11, 1897. He was a pupil of Gigout
at the Niedermeyer School. He has written in almost
every form, and was known far and wide for his wonderful
organ playing. His compositions are graceful
and pure in style, showing remarkable knowledge of
form and facility of technique.
<h4>392 Minuet Gothique (Suite Gothique)</h4>
The suite, of which this graceful minuet is a
part, was dedicated to William C. Carl, the
well-known American organist.
<p>
It is a composition of much merit, and has attained
a degree of popular favor which has required
all concert organists to include it in their
repertoire.
<p>
The suite contains besides the minuet, three
numbers, "Choral," "Priere a Notre-Dame,"
and "Toccata." 
<h4>645 Fantasie Dialogue</h4>
This delightful composition was originally written
for organ and orchestra, but was subsequently
arranged by the composer for the organ 

alone. It is the latter form that we have used 

in the roll.
<p>

A happy choice of thematic material and consummate
skill in the development of it, are characteristic
of Boellmann, and this combination is 

to be found in this roll. More need not be said 

in praise of it. 

<h3>BOROWSKI, Felix 1872-</h3>
This composer and critic was born in Westmoreland,
England, March 10 1872. He was educated privately,
studied violin and piano with private teachers
in London and at the Cologne Conservatoire, his
teacher in composition being Gustave Jensen. For
many years he has been active in musical matters in
Chicago, as critic, teacher, lecturer and composer.
His works include two suites for orchestra, two pieces
for string orchestra, two sonatas and a suite for
organ, a sonata and about sixty pieces for piano,
many vioUn solos and about fifteen songs.
<p>
He possesses a wonderful gift of melody, and his works
all show the hand of the skilled workman. 
<h4>492 Chanson de Mai</h4> 

This "Song of May" is a very beautiful thing. 

It has as graceful a theme as could be desired 

and the thematic material is treated in a masterful
manner. It is a pleasure to find a critic who 

can do things other than to find fault. Borowski
is unique in this respect, and has in this 

composition given us a charming little work. 

<h4>527 Reverie</h4>
A dreamy melody, a thing full of repose is this
from beginning to end. Slippers, a cigar, an
easy chair, quiet and such a tune are all a tired
man could ask.
<h4>603 Priere</h4>
Felix Borowski is a musician and composer of
exceptional ability. He never writes below a
very high level which he seems to have set for
himself. He has done some big things-a
sonata and suite for organ, for instance, both of
which we hope sometime to put on a roll for
the edification of Estey Organ owners. At this
time we are especially concerned with this
smaller number, "Priere." It is a beautiful
work full of real devotional feeling and strikingly
original. 
<h3>BRAHMS, Johannes</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>659 Allegro</h4>
There is never any discussion nowadays about
the quality of Brahms' symphonies. They are
the work of a genius-the last of a long line of
German 	geniuses of which Bach was the first.
There is, however, a wide difference of opinion
as to the quality of that elusive ingredient of
the symphonic formula which entrances the
listener and holds his interest unfalteringly.
To the student, Brahms presents a different
problem. To him, Brahms is like an unexplored
country-new and novel beauties everywhere.
Structurally, the four symphonies are
gigantic masterpieces, and there is little in
music which will pay equal dividends on genuine study.
<p>
One of these symphonies-the second-permits
of no argument on any score. It is gorgeous
from beginning to end.
<p>
For the present roll, we have chosen the first
movement. We are confident that a better
choice could not have been made. To quote
Othello, it "will sing the savageness out of a
bear." 
<h4>714 Allegro con Spirito, Finale of Second Symphony</h4>
The Second Symphony is the great favorite of
all the Brahms symphonies, four in number.
The reason is not difficult to find: it is tuneful
and splendid in form. This constituent, form,
is the greatest single element in the writing of
a symphony. It would be possible to write an
atrocious theme and give it the necessary treatment
to make of it a symphony, but such a thing
would not be beautiful. It is form which relates
architecture to music. Form cannot make a
beautiful thing out of inappropriate materials it
is only when we have proper thematic material,
the design of an artist, and the artisanship
of a master that such things as this symphony
are produced.
<h3>BREAU, Louis, and COOPER, Joe
<h4>713 I Want My Mammy, introducing "Just a Little Love Song"</h4>
We have given here the very popular fox trot,
"I Want My Mammy," and have introduced
the chorus of "Just a Little Love Song." Such
an arrangement has proved to be very popular
for dance purposes. 
<h3>BREWER, John Hyatt</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>678 An Autumn Sketch</h4>
This is a most dainty little caprice written for
the organ. It is a seductively tuneful thing,
full of all the traits necessary to the making
of a caprice. As we have it on the roll, it is
most enjoyable.
<h3>BRUCH, Max 1838-</h3>
Perhaps the most eminent of living German composers
is Max Bruch, who was born at Cologne, January 6,
1838. His mother was a distinguished singer, and she
carefully watched the development of her son's musical
talents. He gave extraordinary promise in composition
during his studies with Breidenstein at Bonn, and
in 1852 gained a scholarship of the Mozart foundation
at Frankfort-on-Main for four years, continuing
his studies under Heller, Reinecke and Breuning
at Cologne. From 1858 to 1861 he taught in his
native town, and in 1858 gave there his first work, an
operetta, "Scherz, List und Rache."
<p>
His works number about ninety, including all forms,
with cantatas and vocal works in the majority. 
<h4>628 Adagio from Violin Concerto, Op.26</h4>
For many years the Bruch Concerto has been
the standard by which aspiring violinists have
been measured. Its requirements are very
great-not so much from a standpoint of technique,
but rather from that of tone and breadth
of musical feeling. A mere technician could
only play the notes. Nothing short of a genuine
musician can bring out its true beauty. We
know of nothing more beautiful than this
Adagio, and in its adaptation to the organ it has
lost nothing.
<h3>BULL, Ole Bornemann 1810-1880</h3>
One of the most picturesque figures in the history of
music was the subject of this paragraph. He was the
son of a physician in Bergen who looked with little
favor upon music as a vocation, and therefore sent
him to the University of Christiania to study theology.
In a very short time he was made conductor of a
musical society of that town. He left Norway very
suddenly in 1829-perhaps as a result of some part
he may have taken in the political feeling rampant at
that time. He suffered many hardships during the
next two years, and finally got to Paris, where he
heard Paganini, whose playing had the effect of making
him settle down to vigorous study of the technique
of the violin. His reduced circumstances and necessary
privation brought upon him severe illness and
despondency. Fortunately a benevolent Parisian lady
took a motherly interest in him at this time, and
nursed him back to health-this lady's daughter later
becoming hia wife. After his recovery he made his
first Paris appearance. His success was from that
time asaured, and he created nothing short of a furore
in Italy. He played in all parts of the world to the
delight of all who heard him, except a certain few who
accused him of charlatanism.
<p>
The fact is, that he was extremely eccentric, but was
nevertheless an extraordinarily capable performer
who had a lot of tricks and a technique which was
probably surpassed by no one but Paganini.
<p>
He seldom played any but his own compositions, but
he could find little else to give scope to hia marvelous
technique.
<h4>394 Alpine Maid's Sunday</h4>
Someone may have written a more delicious
melody than this one, but if so, it is unknown
to us. The melodies which will endure the test
of standing absolutely alone-without harmonies-are
few. This is one. The harmony with
which this gem is clothed was supplied by
Svendsen. and could not be surpassed for
beauty, but nothing in the way of a setting
could add a whit to the exquisiteness of the unadorned
beauty of this melody. 
<h3>CESEK, H. A.</h3>
<h4>598 Twilight</h4>
This is a very attractive melody of the sort
which, while written for the piano, fits the organ
as though made to order. We have used a flute
to voice the first part, while the second part is
played on a violin. On the repetition of the first
theme, one of the wood winds sings the melody,
giving way to the flute in a pretty little coda.
<h3>CHAFFIN, Lucien Gates 1846-</h3>
Lucien Gates Chaffin was born at Worcester, Mass.,
March 23, 1846, received his A.B. from Brown University,
1867. He is an educator of note, and was
a concert organiat for many years, also a critic and
lecturer on music. His compositions are comparatively
few, but of very high order of excellence.
<h4>498 In Springtime</h4>
"The heart is young in Springtime.<br>
Birds sing their merriest notes." Old Poem.
<p>
Here is a gorgeous little piece which is full of
merry notes. In form it is like many other
compositions in this style of organ music, but
here the resemblance ceases, for it is better
far better than the average. The middle part is
a sort of bird song cadenza, after which the
unadorned first theme is used for a close.
<h4>568 Wedding Chimes</h4>
Chaffin is a man who has written comparatively
little that has been published. Judging
from his published works, he is an exacting critic
so far as his own works are concerned. Nothing
trivial or commonplace has come from his pen.
"Wedding Chimes" is a good example of a very
high type of organ music. The title is rather
misleading, as the chimes do not appear in it.
The figure in the bass in the last few measures
is distinctly a chime figure and it is this which
really justifies the title.
<h3>CHAMINADE, Cecile</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>475 Pierrette, Air de Ballet, No.5</h4>
This is one of the dainty little things that Chaminade
writes so well for the piano. Like most
of her work in this vein it lacks definite form but
has a sprightly charm all its own and is distinctly
characteristic of her. It has been put on
the roll for the organ; and in the process has lost
none of its beauty. In fact, it is more interesting
because of the added tonal variety.
<h4>594 Serenade</h4>
The conspicuous characteristic of Chaminade's
compositions is grace. They are never big in
conception, but are invariably full of charm.
Indeed, in most instances they are faultless
miniatures which evince the greatest care in
matters of detail and which withstand the closest
and most exacting scrutiny. Such attention
to detail often produces a perfect but far from
interesting result. Not so with Chaminade!
Her work always possesses the innate charm
which is the result of a fine poetic temperament.
This serenade is no exception to the rule. It
is a most bewitching little thing.
<h4>720 La Lisonjera (The Flatterer)</h4>
We have adapted a few of Chaminade's charming
piano pieces to the organ, and without exception
they have been enthusiastically received.
They have all gained rather than lost by being
fitted to the organ. This graceful number is no
exception. It is too well known to require a
description and, being from Chaminade's pen,
it needs no recommendation. 
<h3>CHOPIN, Frederic Francois</h3>
( For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>393 Nocturne in E flat, Op. 9, No.2</h4>
This is the most popular of all Chopin nocturnes,
and deservedly so. It sings itself into
one's soul, and while it is much abused, its claim
to precedence as a lovely melody is not apt to
be seriously disputed. One is likely to be surprised
at the organ rendition as given by the
present roll. It fits the organ as though made
for it.
<h4>421 Nocturne, Op. 55, No. 1</h4>
This familiar Nocturne needs little comment.
It is very characteristic and while by no means
morbid, has a tinge of sadness in it which is unmistakable.
Much has been written about the
effect of Chopin's music, and no man ever
created such violent contrasts of opinion. His
adherents exhausted their supply of adjectives
in his praise, while others, including just as capable
critics, were relentless in their abuse of him.
In the event of such differences of opinion, one
must judge for one's self what is good. Chopin
was trivial at times but never commonplace. No
one can deny that this nocturne is a pretty tune,
and one which grows in favor on acquaintance
<h4>432 Polonaise (Military)</h4>
The precursor of this stately Polish dance is
supposed by some to have been an ancient
Christmas carol. This theory is supported by
the fact that in former times singing accompanied
the dance. The earliest polonaises extant,
however, are purely instrumental, to which fact
is due the more generally accepted belief that
the dance-as known to us at least-is of courtly
origin, and, according to Grove, came about as
follows:
<p>
"In 1573, Henry III of Anjou was elected to
the Polish throne, and in the following year held
a great reception at Cracow, at which the wives
of the nobles marched in procession past the
throne to the sound of stately music. It is said
that after this, whenever a foreign prince was
elected to the crown of Poland, the same ceremony
was repeated, and that out of it the polonaise
was gradually developed as the opening
dance at court festivities."
<p> 

Bach, Handel, Beethoven, Mozart, Schubert, 

and even Wagner wrote polonaises. It remained
for a native son to develop the national 

dance to its absolute perfection. Before Chopin, 

it was dry and uninteresting; he imbued it with 

new life and spirit, as the present roll will 

testify. 

<h3>COERNE, Louis Adolphe 1870-</h3>
Born in Newark, N.J. February 27, 1870. Was educated
in German and French schools. Graduated from
Boston Latin School in 1888, and Harvard College in
1890. Received the first Ph.D. given by Harvard for
musical work, for his thesis on the Evolution of Modern
Orchestration. He studied composition with J. K.
Paine, violin with Franz Kneisel, organ and composition
with Rheinberger at the Royal Academy, Munich,
from which school he graduated with honors in 1893.
He has led a very active musical life-teaching and
composing. His compositions include a symphonic
poem, "Hiawatha," and two operas, one of which.
"Zenobia," was the first opera by a native of the
United States to be performed in Europe. It was
performed in Bremen, Germany, during the season of
1905-1906. In addition to these are many smaller
works in the usual forms.
<h4>490 The River of Life</h4>
This is a delightfully unpretentious little number
by a man capable of big things. One of the
unmistakable evidences of a big man is his ability
to do the little things well, and keep them
from being commonplace. It has a theme of
unusual beauty, and a middle part which is in
marked contrast. The first theme reappears
and a short coda effects an appropriate close. 
<h4>504 Consecration</h4>
This is one of a number of little things written
by this composer for the organ. It is a delightful
bit of writing and it reveals to the discerning
the musicianship of the composer.
<h3>COHAN, George M. 1878-</h3>
This composer of popular songs made his bow to the
public as an actor as a member of "The Four Cohans."
He has written many successful sketches for vaudeville
and about eighteen plays. His musical ability
is represented by a hundred or more poptilar songs.
<h4>373 Over There</h4>
This is one of the most popular songs inspired
by the war. It has a good swing, and a splendid
war-time quality which is likely to insure its
popularity for some time to come.
<h3>CUI, Cesar Antonovich 1835-</h3>
Thi, famous composer was born at Vilna, January
18, 1835. He is the son of a French officer who, being
unable to follow the retreat from Moscow in 1812, 
remained in Poland, and married a Lithuanian lady,
and became professor in French at the high school at
Vilna.
<p>
Cui received a good preparatory education, and
eventually entered the School of Military Engineering
at St. Petersburg. being appointed to a professorship
after he graduated. He became a recognised authority
on fortification, holding the rank of Lieutenant-General
of Engineers, and has lectured and written much
on the subject.
<p>
Having laid aside his musical tastes during the acquirement
of his military education, he succumbed to
his first love after he had become a full-fledged officer.
His contact with Balakirev had much to do with his
musical enthusiasm. He married a gifted pupil of
Dargomijski, Mlle. Bamberg, and from that time became
very active in composition. Eight operatic
works, over two hundred songs, very many pieces for
piano, strings, orchestra, and many choruses are the
evidence of an etrtremely industrious musical life.
Cui's work is characterized by grace and refined
lyricism. It is seldom tragic.
<h4>547 Orientale</h4>
No one ever wrote miniatures such as this any
better than Cui. He was known as a miniaturist,
and this one example would seem to establish
the claim. It smacks of the Orient, surely,
and is as charming a little thing as could be
found. 
<h3>CZIBULKA, Alphons 1842-1894</h3>
Born at Szepesvavallya, Hungary, on May 14, 1842.
He was a pianist, but proficient enough as a violinist
to become Kapellmeister at the Karltheatre, Vienna,
in 1865. He was a prolific composer, and has left to
his credit many compositions for the piano and five or
six operas.
<h4>610 Love's Dream after the Ball</h4>
Nothing could be more bewitching than this
little tune. It is old-old enough to prove its
goodness. It is exquisitely beautiful.
<h3>DAVIS, Arthur 1877-</h3>
Arthur Davis was born in Birmingham, England. His
musical education included piano, organ, voice, theory
and composition. With such an equipment, Mr. Davis
was well qualified to fill the many important positions
which have fallen to his lot.
<p>
He came to America in 1911 and has since that time
made a name for himself as a concert organist and
teacher. He is now choirmaster and organist of
enriat Church Cathedral in St. Louis.
<p>
Mr. Davis' compositions include works for organ,
piano and voice.
<h4>376 Trailing Arbutus</h4>
This is a charming reverie by a well-known
English organist, now a resident of St. Louis, Mo.
<p>
The opening theme is of a quaint character, and
an interesting and more lively middle part in
marked contrast is a pleasing innovation. After
a somewhat elaborate development of the second
theme, the first theme recurs and serves as
a fitting ending.
<h3>DEBUSSY, Claude Achille</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch aee Catalogue, Volume J)
<h4>403 The Snow is Dancing</h4>
This is Number 4 of a set of children's pieces
by one of the originators of the ultramodern
school. It may be said, also, that this little number
is modern enough to suit the most exacting
in such matters. Its daintiness is its greatest
charm, and it will surely please.
<h3>DEMAREST, Clifford 1874-</h3>
Demarest is a well-known New York organiat who has
composed a goodly number of pieces for the instrument
of his choice, as well as about fifty anthems and 
two sacred-cantatas. His compositions also include a
fantasie for organ and piano, and a number of songs.
He is also the author of "Hints on Organ Accompaniment."
His work is noted for the charm of his melodies.
which are invariably beautiful. They are always
clothed with appropriate harmoniea and all bear the
stamp of sterling musicianship.
<h4>503 Sunset</h4>
This is one of four numbers comprIsmg the
very popular "Pastoral Suite." The first part
is a very graceful melody which gives way to a
chorale-like movement in good contrast. The
first theme recurs with an occasional note on
the chimes which adds materially to the beauty
of the theme as first heard. Two measures of
the chorale and just an echo of the introduction
gracefully effect the close of a delightful
number.
<h3>DETHIER, Gaston Marie 1875-</h3>
Gaston Marie Dethier was born in Liege, Belgium,
on April 19, 1875. Though a Belgian by birth he has
always been regarded in this country as a French
organist. He received his musical education at the
Liege Conservatoire, where he won the gold medal for
piano and organ playing and tke first prize for composition
of a fugue at the age of seventeen. He made
his debut at fourteen at the inaugural recital on the
first tubular-pneumatic organ built in Belgium, at
Malines. In 1894 he was engaged, upon the recommendation
of Guilmant, as organist of St. Francis
Xavier's Church, New York City, where he has remained
until the present time.
<p>
He is actively engaged as a concert organist and
teacher-both privately and at the Institute of Musical
Art. New York.
<p>
Few excel him as a brilliant player on the organ, and
his compositions are widely sought by organists whose
technical equipment is equal to their requirements.
<h4>440 Allegro Gioioso</h4>
This brilliant composition is characteristic of
Dethier and as usual betrays his unusually brilliant
technique. A composer with a limited
technique would never have conceived such a
thing. It is a jolly, rollicking composition-which
at no time expresses a serious thought. Good
humor permeates it and overflows. It would
be difficult indeed to find a number containing
more jollity and mirth than this one.
<p>
It was written for the organ, and the roll gives
it in a manner likely to excite the envy of the
composer himself. 
<h4>462 Barcarole</h4>
From the pen of a composer whose work coruscates
as does Dethier's, one would hardly expect
such a charming bit of simplicity as this Barcarole.
It possesses all the elements of the
boat song-the graceful melody, the swaying
rhythm, etc. That Dethier could write such a
thing proves his musicianship, for only a great
man can do the simple thing so exquisitely as
to avoid the commonplace.
<h4>466 Reverie</h4>
Meditation would have been as good a name but
"what's in a name?" It is both dreamy and
meditative-at times it seems retrospective or
even introspective. Whatever the effect produced,
it is captivating in its quiet simplicity.
<h4>618 Caprice (The Brook)</h4>
Among the difficult concert numbers for organ,
few have enjoyed the popularity of this caprice.
Its technical requirements are such that only
organists of the first class can play it satisfactorily.
Its difficulty does not concern us, however,
for the Estey Organist knows nothing of
difficulties. Its musical value is our chief concern,
and musically it leaves nothing to be desired.
<h4>701 Elegie, Lied, Gavotte</h4>
A number of our clients have complained from
time to time about the brevity of certain of
our rolls. The obvious way of overcoming this
objection is to cut more than one number on a
roll. We shall pursue this policy in the future
as far as it is compatible with good taste.
We have here three little things by a big composer.
They are all delightful and in striking
contrast with each other. Each has a mood of
its own and the combination of the three is a
happy one.
<h3>DETT, R. Nathaniel 1882-</h3>
This pianist and composer was born in Drwmmondville,
P.Q., Canada, in 1882. He graduated from the
Niagara Falls Collegiate Institute in 1905. His musical
education was obtained at the Halsted Conservatory
of Music at Lockport, N.Y., and at Oberlin
College, Oberlin, Ohio. At the latter place, he obtained
the degree of Bachelor of Music. He studied
composition with George W. Andrews and Rossetter
G. Cole, and made his debut all a pianist at Oberlin, 

June, 1908.
<p> 

He is well known as a teacher, and has held very important
positions as director of music in various institutions
of learning. At present he is attached to
the Hampton Institute, Hampton, Va.
<h4>615 Juba</h4>
This is one of five pieces forming the suite, "In
the Bottoms." It is illustrative of negro life
and music. We shall let Mr. Dett describe it:
<p>
"This is probably the most characteristic number
of the suite, as it portrays more of the social
life of the people. Juba is the stamping on the
ground with the foot and following it with two
staccato pats of the hands in 2-4 time. At
least one-third of the dancers keep time in this
way, while the others dance. Sometimes all will
combine together in order to urge on a solo
dancer to more frantic, and at the same time
more fantastic, endeavors. The orchestra usually
consists of a single 'fiddler,' perched high
on a box or table; who, forgetful of self in the
rather hilarious excitement of the hour, does
the impossible in the way of double stopping
and bowing."
<h3>D'EVRY, Edouard 1869-</h3>
Edouard d'Evry, a brilliant organist of French parentage,
received his musical education in London. He
has been organiat of the Brompton Oratory since
1886. Not only has he gained a reputation as a brilliant
performer, but ia known as a composer of organ
pieces, many of which are successful.
<h4>486 Consolation</h4>
This is a composition of distinctly modern tendencies.
It is a really delightful number, written
for the organ, and the more often it is heard
the better it is liked.
<h3>DIGGLE, Roland 1885-</h3>
This composer and organist is well known in the West
and in Canada. He came to Canada from London, his
birthplace, and since 1904 has resided in various parts
of the middle and far West. Since 1914 he has been
organist of St. John's Protestant Episcopal Church
at Los Angeles, Calif., and has made two recital tours
in Canada and one in the United States. He was soloist
at the Panama California Exposition at San Diego
in 1915-1916. Over one hundred of his compositions,
which include many forms, have been published. 
<h4>506 Chant Poetique</h4>
We, in this country, are inclined to look upon a
chant as something of a devotional nature. As
a matter of fact, chant is a French word meaning
song. -It is, therefore, appropriate to designate
a rollicking tune, such as this, a chant. It
is poetical too. A charming rhythm permeates
it from beginning to end, and it is a really delightful
little thing.
<h4>513 At Sunset</h4>
A quiet and beautiful melody is this. It might
have been called a nocturne-which it is. Its
beauty may be attributed to its grace. Serenity
is its keynote.
<h4>521 Reverie Triste</h4>
This song of sadness is a thing of much fascination.
There is nothing dolorous or lugubrious
about it, but it is plaintive in the extreme. It
is one of a number of delightful little pieces
written by this composer for the organ.
<h3>DONALDSON, Walter</h3>
<h4>401 How ' Ya Goin' to Keep Him Down on a Farm?</h4>
<h3>DRDLA, Franz</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>665 Serenade</h4>
There is no more popular composer today in
Bohemia-now a part of Czecho-Slovakia than
Drdla. He has written many pieces for
the concert room which deserve and enjoy a
wide degree of popularity.
Two of them are well known in this country,
namely, Souvenir (Estey Roll No. 349) and
Serenade, the present roll.
Both these compositions were written for the
composer's own instrument, the violin. They
are both gems, and serve well as an example of
the fidelity with which the string tone is reproduced
in Estey organs.
<h3>DUBOIS, Francois Clement Theodore</h3>
(For BiographicaZ Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>707 March Triomphale</h4>
A march of fine spirit and dignity is this one
from the pen of the famous organist of the
Madeleine, Paris. It is typical of the French
style, which is a good style. It is vigorous and
triumphant-and beautiful.
<h3>DVORAK, Antonin</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>405 Bagatello, Op. 47, Nos. 1, 2 and 3</h4>
By virtue of his residence and musical activity
in New York, Dvorak has endeared himself to
Americans generally. It may be said, however,
without fear of contradiction, that his first claim
to favor was through the bewitching beauty of
his compositions-and so should it be. Nevertbeless,
it cannot be denied that a special interest
attaches to all his work because of his sojourn
in the United States.
<p>
Of the five bagatelles in Op. 47, three are given
on this roll, and more delectable music would be
difficult to find. Dvorak was not known as a
composer until his thirty-second year. At that
rather late period in life to begin, a patriotic
hymn struck the popular fancy. In 1877 he was
discovered by Brahms, whose perspicacity in
musical matters caused him to use his influence
with Simrock, the publisher, to publish Dvorak's
compositions. The Slavonic Dances, Op. 46,
were first to appear, and the reception given
them encouraged the publisher to bring out
many compositions which Dvorak had long
despaired of seeing in print. From this time on,
Dvorak was recognized as a finished composer
and his works were much sought after. 
This enchanting music will make its own place
in the hearts of all who hear the roll, and it needs
no description to add to its enjoyment.
<h4>519 Allegro and Larghetto from Terzetto, Op. 74</h4>
Dvorak is best known to us through his symphonies
and quartettes. Here, however, we
have two movements of an exquisite trio for two
violins and viola, which we have put upon a
roll for organ use. It is charming music, bright
and cheery in the first movement, and different
but no less attractive in the wistful larghetto.
The roll gives it on the string stops, producing
the effect intended by the composer with commendable
fidelity.
<h3>EDMOND, Lemaigre</h3>
<h4>510 Prayer</h4>
This is a very beautiful and devotional melody
which is sung on the Vox Humana with an
arpeggio accompaniment on the harp. On
repetition the theme is played on the strings
and a flute obligato weaves its way in and out
in ingenious and delightful fashion. This is a
composition for the organ and the roll does it
full justice. 
<h3>ELGAR, Sir Edward</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch aee Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>487 Chanson de Matin</h4>
Song of the Morning, he calls it, and it is an
appropriate title. It is a charming composition
with the freshness of the dew upon it. Indeed,
it sounds as if it had been written in the morning.
It is a formless little thing which wanders
about in carefree fashion, to the delight of all
who hear it.
<h4>567 Chanson de Nuit</h4>
Much is expected of Elgar, and one is rarely
disappointed. Here is a little song of the night,
written for the violin. We have transcribed it
for the organ with very happy results. It is still
a violin solo, but in the case of the roll the organ
furnishes the violin. Incidentally, this number
provides an excellent opportunity to observe the
fine imitative quality of Estey string stops.
<h4>601 Canto Popoiare</h4>
The popular song of this country is distinctly
different from the kind here recorded. Elgar
has chosen a tune of much beauty and has
clothed it with delightful harmonies in his usual
masterful way. 
<h3>ELLIOTT, Zo</h3>
<h4>368 There's a Long, Long Trail</h4>
Of the many sentimental songs written in the
last few years this is one of the most popular
and one of the best. It has a catchy refrain,
which is known to many who are not familiar
with the rest of the song, and is effectively given
on the organ from the roll.
<h3>FAULKES, William 1863-</h3>
This organist, pianist and composer, was born in Liverpool,
England, November 4, 1863. He has taught in
Liverpool since 1886, is well known as a composer,
having written a concerto for piano, also one for
violin, besides some chamber music and many pieces
for piano. His organ works include the larger forms,
such as concert overtures, etc., also many in the
smaller forms.
<h4>508 Pastorale</h4>
The pastorale is a melody in 6-8, 9-8 or 12-8
time, in imitation of the simple melody of the
shepherd's pipe. A drone bass very often furnishes
the foundation, as is the case with this
one, which is a splendid example of the form. 
<h4>509 Minuet and Trio</h4>
This is a very good example of the minuet form
in the key of B minor, containing excellent
variety both in its subjects as well as in its
treatment. Particularly melodious is the trio
in the key of G major, with its tonic and dominant
pedal. The return to the original subject
is both ingenious and effective.
<h4>536 Barcarole</h4>
This is a fine two-part boat song, with a beautiful
running accompaniment which is as incessant
as the babbling of a brook, and as delightful.
A middle part of considerable vigor furnishes
the necessary contrast and this most
charming number closes with the repetition of
the first theme.
<h4>619 Concert Overture in D</h4>
A composition from the pen of this versatile and
prolific English organist is always worth while.
Here we have an overture written for the
organ, which is a delight. It is fine in form.
beautiful in thematic material and masterful in
workmanship-which is about all that could be
said in praise of any composition.  
<h4>673 Wedding Chimes</h4>
A remarkable chime effect is obtained in this
number by somewhat peculiar registration.
Organists frequently use four- and sixteen-foot
stops together for this purpose, which is what
we have done here. Faulkes was in a particularly
happy frame of mind when he wrote this
charming piece. We have used the registration
he prescribed throughout, thus carrying out the
full intentions of the composer.
<h4>675 Spring Song</h4>
One of the best known of the many spring songs
is this one by the well-known English composer
and organist, William Faulkes. It is a delightful
melody and the workmanship is of the usual
high standard to be expected of him. A very
unique and clever middle part adds wonderfully
to the general scheme. The first theme
then reappears with a florid accompaniment,
adding variety and charm to a very beautiful
and unpretentious bit of writing.
<h4>680 Nocturne</h4>
Not the least of the many talents of this well known
English composer is his remarkable gift
of melody. In a simple form like the nocturne,
melody is the essential thing. In this case the
theme is charming in its simplicity. A rather
more vigorous middle part leads up to a repetition
of the first theme in chords accompanied
by an exceedingly graceful florid figure. It is
a splendid example of the nocturne form.
<h3>FAURE, Jean-Baptiste</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume J)
<h4>463 Romance</h4>
Faure's particular claim to distinction lies in
his ability to write charming melodies. This
one is no exception, and will prove a delight to
all who hear it. In the latter part a second
voice appears and forms a most fascinating
duet which continues to the close.
<h3>FEDERLEIN, Gottfried H. 1883-</h3>
Gottfried H. Federlein was born in New York City,
December 31,1883. He is the son of a famous organist
who is now retired, but is known as a teacher of
singing, also as the author of a "School of Voice Culture,"
and essays on Wagner's "Ring of the Nibelungen." 

Our subject is one of the best-known of American organists
and is a composer of great promise. He secured
his musical education in New York, being the 

pupil of Biedermann, Goetschius and Saar. Besides 

his organ piecea, his compositions include sacred and 

secular songs, and aome music for the violin. 

<h4>474 Scherzo Pastorale</h4>
This might be characterized a scherzo in tempo
and a pastorale in rhythm and form. It certainly
contains elements of both forms, and it
was a happy idea to combine them. In any
event, it is a matter of little moment to us
whether the form is orthodox or not; the result
is highly entertaining and displays a wealth of
ability on the part of the composer. He has
here given us a work of great beauty,
<h3>FERRATA, Giuseppe 1865-</h3>
This pianist and composer was born at Gradoli,
Romagna, January 1, 1865. He studied at the St.
Cecilia Acadamy, at Rome, having won a scholarship
at the age of fourteen. He won the prize of the
Ministry of Public Instruction. After receiving some
lessons from Liszt, he toured Italy as a pianiat, with
much success.
<p>
He came to America and for a number of years was
dean of the Music Department of Beaver College.
Beaver. Pa., and is now head of the Piano Department
and professor of composition at Newcomb College
and Tulane University. New Orleans.
<p>
He was knighted by the King of Portugal in 1887.
<h4>465 Nocturne</h4>
Ferrata's compositions are characterized by a
free flowing melody accompanied by ever changing
harmonies-almost kaleidoscopic at
times. This number is no exception in either
respect. It is dainty at all times, such a thing
as one might expect from a skilled Italian composer.
Indeed, it is a charming bit of melody,
supported by a beautiful and appropriate harmonic
structure.
<h4>488 Reverie Triste, Op. 9, No. 4</h4>
This is the sort of thing one likes to hear
when in a meditative mood. Dim the lights,
and listen to this roll in absolute quiet. If it
does not leave an impression, your case is hopeless.

<h3>FIBICH, Zdenko 1850-</h3>
This composer was born in Seborschitz, Bohemia, December
10, 1850. He studied at Vienna and Prague,
and later became a pupil at the Leipsic Conservatory
under Moscheles, Richter and Jadassohn. His works,
though little known in this country, number about
seven hundred, including operas, symphonic poems,
chamber music, song., etc.
<h4>672 A Melody, A Pensive Mood, Song Without Words</h4>
We have here, on one roll, three miniatures by 

a famous Bohemian composer. These pieces 

are happily mated on the one roll. The moods 

are not dissimilar, yet there is variety enough 

to prevent monotony.
<h3>FOOTE, Arthur William 1858-</h3>
Arthur William Foote is one of the most notable and
prolific American composers. His activities as a composer
have taken in practically all the accepted forms,
and a great quantity of excellent music bears his name.
<p>
He has written much chamber music, most of which
was given its premier performance by the Kneisel
Quartette, a fact which of itself stamps Foote as a
composer of a very high order. Similar testimony
may be found in the fact that the Boston Symphony
Orchestra has done him the honor to give most of his
orchestral wrks their first public reading.
<p>
As a performer on both piano and organ Foote belongs
in the first rank. He was organist of the First
Unitarian Church, Boston, from 1878 to 1910, where
he gave numerous recitals which were largely attended.
<h4>436 Pastorale, Op. 29, No.3</h4>
Almost every composer of note since the time
of Bach and Handel has given expression to
his feelings in a "Pastorale." It would therefore
be surprising if Foote, with his wealth of
melody, should not have tried his hand at this
form. Indeed, it would have been unfortunate,
for here is as pretty a piece of writing as one
could wish. A delightful flowing melody, peaceful
in the extreme, wanders around aimlessly
through a number of different keys, all the while
accompanied by the most exquisite harmonies,
and finally returns home.
<p>
This Pastorale is a most charming thing. It was
made for the organ and it fits.
<h4>683 Nocturne, Op. 50, No. 6</h4>
America has developed few if any better composers
than Arthur Foote. He is a charming
melodist, as is proven by this Nocturne. It is
quiet and peaceful-just the thing to listen to
in a dimly lighted room. 
<h3>FRANCK, Cesar</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch Bee Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>441 Cantabile</h4>
In this Cantabile of Cesar Franck we have a
composition of transcendent beauty. One must
listen a little below the surface to get the wondrous
musical message contained in the superlative
harmonies.
<p>
The food value of compositions such as this
cannot be overestimated. The harmonies are
anything but obvious, yet are not forced or
unnatural. From beginning to end the careful
listener will notice the composer's fondness for
intervals of semitones, both in melodies and
accompaniment, but principally in the latter.
This is not a weakness, but a characteristic, and
one productive of gorgeous effects when applied
with the consummate skill of this great man.
This roll is worthy of all the attention and scrutiny
it can be given. It grows more beautiful
with each hearing.
<h4>543 Piece Heroique</h4>
This is a very pretentious composition for the
organ. It is Franck at his best. All the characteristics
which have stamped him as a modem
genius are here. It is a very wonderful work. 
<h4>651 Choral, A Minor</h4>
This is the third of a set of three chorals written
for the organ by Cesar Franck, the great Belgian
composer. It is also the most popular and
best known of the set.
<p>
In it he betrays unmistakably his allegiance to
Bach. It is a curious circumstance that Franck,
an ultramodern, should have chosen Bach as his
model. Franck lacks nothing in originality, but
there are, undeniably, passages in his writings
which Bach might have written-and to his
credit. The present roll has in it some such
passages, and their analogy is interesting.
<h4>721 Symphony in D Minor</h4>
Cesar Franck, as we have said in our biographical
sketch of him, was a Belgian by birth, but a
Frenchman by adoption.
<p>
It is well to remember this in connection with
the fact that his influence on the French school
of music was far greater than the influence of
the French school upon him. He is said to be
the father of the modem French school. This
is probably so, but if the dear old man could
come to life, it is doubtful if he would recognize
some of his children. 
<p>
Franck was a radical and must have had a hard
time with the skeptics of his day. He felt, however,
that he had a message and that it was his
privilege to deliver it in his own way. Indeed,
such was the case, and what he said could not
have been as well said in any other way, or by
anybody else.
<p>
It is with his only symphony that we have to do
here. In that one symphony he seems to have
epitomized all that went before and all that was
to come in the way of symphonic writing. A
description of it would be most futile. It may
be well, however, to call attention to the use
of the principal theme in all the movements; a
thing which we believe had not been done before.
In the freedom of development and orchestration
he actually rivals Beethoven.
<h3>FRANZOFF, Boris</h3>
<h4>661 Romance</h4>
Romance is perhaps the proper title for this
little composition. As a romance should be, it
is a tender, simple melody of great beauty. 
<h3>FRIML, Rudolf 1881-</h3>
Rudolf Friml waa born in Prague, Bohemia, December
7, 1881. He obtained hia musical education at
the Prague Conservatory and came to this country as
accompanist to Kubelik. After a tour with the violinist
he appeared with success as a concert pianist in
recitals and with the orchestra. He now devotes his
entire time to composition, and is remarkably successful,
having written a number of musical comedies
which have received the unstinted approbation of the
public. "The Firefly," "High Jinks" and "Katinka"
are among his efforts for the stage.
<h4>491 Twilight</h4>
This is an unpretentious piece of much melodic
beauty, which has been admirably transcribed
for the organ. It is an easy-flowing tune which
fits the organ as though made for it.
<h4>585 Melodie</h4>
This melody is in effect a song without words.
It is in a light vein but of splendid workmanship.
In the arrangement of the roll, due cognizance
of the possibilities for color effects has
been taken; the saxophone, flute and violin appearing
as solo instruments, while in the coda
we have a chorus of strings accompanied by the
harp. The roll is charmingly effective from
beginning to end. 
<h4>595 Russian Romance</h4>
This is one of the most popular of the many
well-known compositions by this Bohemian composer.
He has done much in a light vein, but
nothing more deservedly popular than this. It
is full of charming melody and splendidly harmonized.
<h3>FRY, Henry S. 1875-</h3>
Henry S. Fry was born at Pottstown, Pa., April 27,
1875. He is one of the best-known of American organists,
having given over six hundred recitals. He is
very active in the affairs of the National Association
of Organists, having been president of the association
in 1920.
<p>
As organist of St. Clement's, Philadelphia, he has
established an enviable reputation as a service player
as well as a recitalist. He devotes most of his time to
teachmg and to literary work on musical subjects,
being a regular contributor to a number of musical
periodicals. Most of his compositions are in manuscript.
<h4>623 Sicilano</h4>
Few if any unpretentious numbers are in
greater demand for recital purposes than this
bit of dainty writing. It is to be found on the 
programmes of organists, great and small. The
technical requirements are not very great, but
it requires a goodly share of musical instinct to
do it justice. The present roll was played by
the composer and is a charming thing.
<h3>FRYSINGER, J. Frank 1878-</h3>
Concert organist, composer and teacher. Born at
Hanover, Pa., April 7, 1878. He atudied with Frederick
Wolff, Baltimore; S. Camillo Engle, Edgar Stillman
Kelly and Richard Burmeister, New York; Ralph
Kinder, Philadelphia, and W. Wolstenholme, London.
His compositions include about thirty piecea for organ
and over seventy for piano, in many of the accepted
forms. He is at present attached to the University
School of Music at Lincoln, Nebraska.
<h4>495 At Parting of Day</h4>
This is a delightful little bit of sentimentality
which was composed for the organ by a man
who has a highly pleasing gift of melody. The
theme is very graceful and is clothed with most
appropriate harmonies.
<h4>605 At Twilight</h4>
Here is a fine flowing melody with a rather
unusual rhythm. The first theme is in 6-4 time,
and the middle part in 5-4. The second theme
is repeated with a sprightly obligato on the
flutes. All in all, it is a very interesting and
pleasing composition.
<h3>GALBRAITH, J. Lamonte</h3>
<h4>582 Reverie</h4>
As it should be, this is a dreamy sort of thing
pleasantly dreamy. It has rather more form
than most reveries, but is not hampered by it.
It is a really charming piece.
<h3>GAY, Byron</h3>
<h4>454 The Vamp</h4>
Fox-trotting to the "Vamp" is the popular
thing these days. Those among the nimble~
footed who do not succumb to the speU of this
strange bit of music, are a hopeless minority.
Everybody does the "Vamp."
<h3>GILLETTE, James Robert 1886-</h3>
This organist and composer was born at Roseboom,
N. Y., May 30,1886. He graduated from Syracuse
University, where he studied organ with Harry Vibbard,
and composition with William Berwald. He is
at present Professor of Organ and Composition at
Wesleyan College, Macon, Ga. An annual recital tour
has given him wide reputation as a concert organist.
<h4>530 Chanson de Matin</h4>
This is in all essentials like most songs of the
morning. It is melodious and cleverly written.
Its possibilities for unique and interesting registration
will be noted at once and appreciated.
It is a delightful little thing.
<h3>GODARD, Benjamin</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>423 Au Matin</h4>
This is an enchanting little piano piece, which
has been skillfully adapted to the organ with
very satisfactory results. It is in the flowing,
melodious style so characteristic of French composers,
and Godard in particular. It is not a
classic, but is a thing of much charm and beauty. 
<h4>493 Canzonetta from Concerto Romantique</h4>
Here is an almost unequaled example of musical
coruscation. Traveling along with a tune
of unusual brilliance are harmonies of superlative
beauty which continually change with kaleidoscopic
suddenness until one wonders where
this jumping about from key to key will end.
Such a thing could not have been written by
any but a man of very great talent. It has been
said of Godard that he was too easily satisfied
with his own work, but there is in this instance
no evidence of carelessness; there is the evidence
of genius and a real joy in his work. It is beautiful
in the extreme.
<h3>GOUNOD, Charles Francois</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>723 There is a Green Hill Far Away</h4>
This is one of Gounod's most inspired sacred
songs. Nothing could surpass the appropriateness
of the music to the poem. It would seem
almost that they were conceived together. We
have made a delightful organ arrangement of 
this wonderful song which we are sure will
appeal to all admirers of such music. A more
devout or reverential bit of music does not exist.
<h3>GRAINGER, Percy Aldridge 1883-</h3>
The subject of this paragraph was born in Brighton,
Victoria, Australia, July 8, 1883. He received most
of his education at home, from his mother, who also
was his chief instructor in music. He made his debut
as a pianist at the age of ten at Melbourne, Australia.
He later studied with Kwast at Frankfort, and Busoni
at Berlin. He has toured Europe extensively, and his
undisputed genius has met with cordial recognition
everywhere. Among his seventy compositions are
found works in nearly all forms. He is particularly
happy as an arranger of old tunes, which he "dishes up,"
to use a phrase of his own, in most palatable fashion.
<p>
He has resided in New York for the past few years,
and in 1917 enlisted in the American Army. He was
assigned to the band of the Fifteenth Coast Artillery
Corps as saxophonist.
<h4>391 Molly on the Shore</h4>
This number consists of two old Irish Reels,
"Temple Hill" and "Molly on the Shore."
These two tunes have been most ingeniously
woven together into a most charming bit of
music. It is in things like this that Grainger is
best known to Americans as a composer.
<p>
This delightful bit of Irish music is of the sort
that makes one wish for more, especially as the
organ plays it.
<h4>617 Irish Tune from County Derry</h4>
Nothing need be said of Grainger's ability in the
arrangement and harmonization of folk music.
He has done a number of things in a most
charming and original manner. In this instance,
he used a tune of Irish but unknown
origin-nameless even. Grainger got the tune
from "The Petrie Collection of the Ancient
Music of Ireland" and we think Petrie's paragraph,
which accompanies the tune, would be of
interest. We therefore quote it:
<p>
"For the following beautiful air, I have to express
my very grateful acknowledgement to
Miss J. Ross of New Town, Limavady, in the
County of Londonderry-a lady who has made
a large collection of the popular unpublished
melodies of the county, which she has very
kindly placed at my disposal, and which has
added very considerably to the stock of tunes
which I had previously acquired from that still
very Irish county. I say 'still very Irish,' for
though it has been planted for more than two
centuries by English and Scottish settlers, the
old Irish race still forms the great majority
of its peasant inhabitants; and there are few, if
any, counties in which, with less foreign admixture,
the ancient melodies of the country have
been so extensively preserved. The name of the
tune unfortunately was not ascertained by Miss
Ross, who sent it to me with the simple remark
that it was 'very old,' in the correctness of which
statement I have no hesitation in expressing my
perfect concurrence."
<h3>GRETCHANINOW, Alexander Tichonovitch 1864-</h3>
One of the most important Russian composers, Alexander
Gretchaninow, was born at Moscow, October 25,
1864. He studied piano with Safonov at the Moscow
Conservatoire, and composition with Rilmsky-Korsakow
at the Petrograd Conservatoire. His instrumental
works are said to show traces of German influence, but
his church music, of which he has written much, follows
the best Russian traditions. He has written two
operas, two symphonies, three string quartettes and
numerous choruses, songs, etc. 
<h4>551 Meditation</h4>
A very aptly named little piece. It might be an
improvisation. It is formless-just wandering
about, going nowhere in particular, but doing it
delightfully. And when it gets to the end of
its journey, unlike some other things, it stops.
<h4>576 Cradle Song</h4>
Composers great and small have tried their
hands at the song somnolent. Many of these
efforts have resulted in most charming music, as
in the present case. Simplicity is the charm of
this little gem, as it is in all good cradle songs.
<h3>GRIEG, Edvard Hagerup</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>395 Solvejg's Song, Peer Gynt Suite, No.2</h4>
This is a melody of remarkable appeal, and
such a one as only Grieg could have written.
The inspiration was taken from Peer Gynt and
the song occurs when Peer Gynt returns to his
hut in the forest, and finds Solvejg awaiting
him. He dies in her arms as she croons this
beautiful melody. 
<h4>402 March qf the Dwarfs, Op. 54, No. 3</h4>
This is one of a set of lyrical pieces for piano.
It is quite grotesque and a most bewitching bit
of writing. The organ provides the necessary
medium for a most satisfactory rendition.
<h4>596 Berceuse</h4>
Of the many lyrical pieces by Grieg, none is
better known than this Berceuse. Nothing
could be more beautiful, or more in keeping
with its title. It would not be classed as a difficult
thing to play, but it is not without troublesome
spots, which, if not played with consummate
ease and grace, are apt to ruin the effect.
The Estey Organist recognizes none of these
difficulties and the effect is charming.
<h4>597 Norwegian Dance, Springtanz, Elegie, Waltzer Opus 38</h4>
In the set of lyrical pieces comprising Op. 38,
there are a number which are splendidly adaptable
to the organ. One roll, No. 596, contains
the lovely Berceuse from this opus. The present
roll contains four of the most charming
numbers of the set. They are four beautiful
miniatures and are representative of Grieg at
his best.
<h4>604 To Spring, Op. 43, No. 6</h4>
Perhaps none of Grieg's lyric pieces is better
known than this charming little spring song.
In adapting it to the organ, nothing has been
lost; indeed, in spots the organ seems to bring
out the composer's intent better than the piano.
<h3>GUILMANT, Felix Alexandre</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>414 Priere et Berceuse</h4>
This number is of a type of which Guilmant was
particularly fond. He delighted in anything
suggesting tranquillity, and was at his best when
working along lines of simple melody. As a
contrapuntist he was excelled by but few of
his time, but he seemed to take the greatest joy
in allowing his mind to wander along with a
tune of exquisite beauty and refinement. No 
one was ever more fastidious or discriminating
in the choice of subject material than Guilmant,
therefore his themes were always well worth the
work he put upon them in the way of development,
ornamentation, etc.
<p>
The present roll is highly characteristic. It
opens with a very slow movement (Prayer)
which serves as an introduction to a lovely slumber
song (Berceuse), which is uttered first in
simplest fashion and later elaborated upon. A
portion of the slow movement then recurs and
brings the delightful number to a close.
<h4>431 Caprice, Op. 20, No.3</h4>
The serious side of Guilmant is well known and
understood. Here, however, is an example of
whimsicality which would do credit to a Haydn,
and a degree of jocundity wholly unexpected
from a pen so used to recording expressions of
dignity and religious feeling. It is always interesting
to discover a new angle from which a
great man can be viewed, and this delightful bit
of writing will shed a new light on this great
man's personality which will add interest to all
of his compositions.
<p>
It was written for the organ, and the roll gives
it in a manner approached by none but the most
skillful organists. 
<h4>584 Nuptial March</h4>
Here is a glorious march by the inimitable
Frenchman. He was a pigmy in stature, but a
giant in intellect. He never stooped to frivolity,
he was often jovial, frequently humorous, but
his every mood was dignified.
<p>
This wedding march is as fine an example of
march writing as is to be found.
<h4>625 Grand Chorus in March Form</h4>
No better compositions for organ are to be
found than those of the great Frenchman. He
always felt that whatever thematic material he
selected was worthy of painstaking treatment,
resulting invariably in sturdy, wholesome music.
In this instance we have a splendid march,
vigorous and inspiriting, such as only Guilmant
could write. No one knew better than he the
effects possible on the organ, or the way to
obtain them. He was master of his instrument.
<h4>630 Andante con Moto</h4>
This movement was dedicated to Cavaille Coll,
the great French organ builder and friend of
Guilmant. Guilmant has here written some of 
the loveliest of organ music. It is organ music
and nothing else. An arrangement of it for
anything else would profane it. The opportunity
for tone coloring has not been overlooked
in the making of the roll.
<h4>632 Cantilene Pastorale</h4>
This is Number 3 of Opus 15. It is Guilmant
in one of his sprightly moods. By a singular
coincidence it contains a phrase which is identical
with one in Grieg's "Anitra's Dance." This
sort of thing happens much more often among
the classic writers than is generally supposed.
Of course there is no thought of plagiarism
concerning men of this calibre. It simply happened.
This Cantilene is full of charming
melody and harmony woven together in the
usual masterful manner. It is organ music and
the roll does it full justice.
<h4>633 First Meditation</h4>
The theme of this Meditation savors somewhat
of a pastorale. Much of its charm is due to its
simplicity. In the development of the theme,
many delightful incidents occur. It is full of
tone color and is a splendid organ number. 
<h4>637 Marche Religieuse</h4>
From time to time we have remarked on the
masterful workmanship of this great French
organist. He considered any theme of his selection
worthy of the best treatment he was able
to give it. In this instance, he has selected a
theme from Handel's Messiah- "Lift up Your
Heads." Nothing, therefore, need be said in
praise of the theme. The astonishing thing
about this march is the middle part. Suddenly,
after the principal theme has held full sway for
a time, a free fugue enters. It trips along in
most interesting fashion, when unexpectedly,
the first theme reappears with the fugal theme
as a contrapuntal ornament. The march concludes
with the principal theme in massive
chords on the full organ. It is a wonderful
thing on first hearing, but it must be heard
again and again to grasp its full worth.
<h4>649 Largo e Maestoso</h4>
There are people who possess the silly idea that
a great man-a big man-must be big in stature.
This idea is more or less prevalent despite
the numerous cases which may be cited to the
contrary. To prove the erroneousness of such
an idea we need, for our purpose, only to mention
Guilmant (to say nothing of Beethoven).
Here is a sonata, built on the lines laid down by
Beethoven, which is so masterful in theme and
workmanship as to cause the listener to forget
entirely the fact that it is written according to a
definite form. It is a gorgeous piece of musical
architecture.
<h4>662 Finale from First Sonata</h4>
We have already listed the first movement of
this Sonata under No. 649. The pastorale,
which is the second movement, will appear as
No. 676. These two, with the present roll, constitute
the entire sonata. The finale is a tempestuous
allegro, and in marked contrast to the
pastorale which precedes it. It is also in Guilmant's
inimitable style, which is all that need
be said in praise of it.
<h4>676 Pastorale from First Sonata</h4>
Students of Beethoven are familiar with his
fondness for themes of the simplest character.
In his chamber music in particular, he frequently
used four or five notes of the scale in
sequence, either up or down. In the selection
of thematic material this Pastorale reminds us 
of Beethoven. Here we find the theme beginning
with the first six notes of the scale of A
major in their proper order. Later on, we find
the full scale, and more, used. Along in the
middle we hear, most appropriately, a portion
of a fine chorale, accompanied by the shepherd's
pipe. The first theme is then developed and the
close is effected by the use of two complete
octaves of the scale of A major, with the dying
strains of the chorale as an accompaniment. It
is truly a wonderful composition. Anything
more beautiful would be difficult to imagine
and more difficult to find.
<h4>694 Offertoire, Elevation in F, Carol for Christmastide</h4>
The present roll contains three numbers, as
shown above. Our reason for cutting the three
numbers on one roll was that they seemed to belong
together. The Offertory is based on the
two Christmas carols, "Great God" and "Come, 

Shepherds, Awake"; the Elevation on the carol, 

"Shepherds of the Mountains"; the Carol for 

Christmastide on the carols, "Let Us Sing 

Loudly," "Noel," and "Christ Is Born." 
<p>
All three of these numbers display the skill
of the great French composer, and are fine
examples of organ music.
<h4>695 March from the Ariane Symphony</h4>
The French school of composers were all fond
of the march form, none more than Guilmant.
He seemed to find expression in this form for
his pent-up energy. It would be difficult to
conceive a more vigorous thing than this. It is
a delightful example of Guilmant with a free rein.
<h4>709 Lamentation</h4>
Guilmant dedicates this splendid work to the
"memory of my friend, the Abbe Henri Gros,
killed on the plateau of Avron, December 27,
1870 (bombardment of Paris), aged thirty-one
years." Mention of the bombardment of Paris
need no longer take us back to 1870, and this
tribute to Guilmant's friend may with singular
appropriateness be rededicated to others who
met their death in a similar way. Aside from its
historical interest this lamentation is a work of
unusual interest. It is dignified, plaintive, and
reverential, but never doleful or lugubrious. 
<h3>GUION, David W.</h3>
<h4>573 Turkey in the Straw</h4>
What should be said about this old tune cannot
be better said than by the author of the present
transcription. We quote him:
<p>
"'Turkey in the Straw' every American, of
course, knows, but not as I do, for I have danced
to it thousands of times out here (Texas) at
the cowboy dances until I was almost ready to
drop. I do not know why, where, when or hy
whom it was written, but the cowboys and old
fiddlers rather look upon it as their 'national
anthem.' In this concert transcription I have
tried to write it just as I have so often heard it
whistled and played by our funny old fiddlers,
the cowpunchers and cowboys."
<p>
We have adhered strictly to the text as arranged
by Mr. Guion, and have simply fitted it to the
organ with most fascinating results.
<p>
Mr. Guion is an American musician, born in
Ballinger, Texas, in 1895.
<h3>HALSEY, Ernest</h3>
<h4>570 Festal Postlude</h4>
This is a vigorous postlude of conventional type
but much better quality of writing than the
average. It is full of interesting contrasts and 
is a fine number to show the tonal possibilities
of a fine organ. It is characteristic of the English
school of writing and is a splendid example
of dignified organ music.
<h3>HANDEL, George Frederick</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue. Volume 1)
<h4>544 Allegro from Sixth Concerto</h4>
This is the first movement from the Number 6
organ Concerto. For a number of years these
concertos have been somewhat neglected, but of
late seem to be reestablishing themselves in high
places. The music is old-fashioned, but most
things are that are one hundred and eighty years
old, and antiques never go out of fashion, especially
musical antiques.
<h4>666 Sarabande</h4>
The sarabande is an ancient stately dance. Its
origin is a matter of much speculation. Fuertes
says it was invented in the middle of the sixteenth
century by a Spaniard named Zarabanda.
Others attribute it to a Spaniard
named Sarao. 
Sir William Ousley claimed it was of Turkish
or Persian origin, Ser-band.
<p> 

Whatever its origin it enjoyed years of popularity
all through Europe during the sixteenth 

century. To us it seems very unlike a dance 

tune. We cannot deny its musical worth, however,
and it is this phase of it which concerns us. 

<h3>HAUSER, Miska</h3>
Hauser was a very famous Hungarian violinist, born
in Presburg in 1822. When only twelve years of age,
he made a world tour, meeting with the greatest success
wherever he played. In 1840 he toured Germany,
Sweden, Norway and Russia; in 1850, London and
other English cities. From 1853-1858 he visited California,
South America and Australia. In 1860 he was,
feted by King Victor Emmanuel of Italy and the Sultan
of Turkey. His composition, are little known except
a set of Lieder Ohne Worte (Songs Without Words)
which will survive for many years to come.
<h4>705 Wiegenlied</h4>
For many years this little gem has been a
favorite encore number with violinists and the
public. The reason is obvious, for it is a superlatively
beautiful melody clothed with the
simplest and most appropriate harmonies. It is
truly an enchanting thing. 
<h3>HAYDN, Franz Joseph</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>535 Andante from Symphony NO.4, Clock Movement</h4>
A hearing of just a few measures of this delightful
music suffices as an explanation of the
name which it has been given. The ticking of
the clock begins the movement, and continues
almost incessantly throughout.
<p>
After a measure of "tick-tock" a most exuberant
melody fashioned in Haydn's own mould
asserts itself, and the development which follows
is a fair example of Haydn's skill in composition.
It is a charming movement from the
moment the clock begins to tick until it runs
down at the end.
<h4>737 Adagio, Presto, Symphony in D (Clock Symphony)</h4>
In this Symphony, Haydn has revealed his
many-sided nature. In the introduction to the
first movement, the Adagio, we have a sombre
and solemn announcement. It is a proclamation
which seems to foreshadow a theme of
dignified and stately character.
When he comes to the point, however, we find 
we have been fooled. Instead of the expected
theme we have a tune which is nothing short of
waggish-indeed, just the tune one would expect
from a chap who would deliberately cut the
pigtail off a fellow chorister's wig. Away he
rides on this mischievous, sprightly tune, in unrestrained
and irresponsible merriment. Nobody but
Haydn could, or at least did, write
such a tune. Directly he makes a counter-theme
out of the first theme by turning it upside down.
Then the second theme is fashioned out of the
second principal theme-principally by changing
the accent, now the most brilliant polyphony;
by way of development, the most delightful
musical banter and badinage-all so
characteristic of Haydn that it never once occurs
to us that anyone else could have written it.
<h4>738 Minuetto, Allegretto, Symphony in D (Clock Symphony)</h4>
The so-called Minuetto has all the earmarks of a
scherzo. "Grove's Dictionary" says, "When we
come to Haydn the term minuet ceases to have
any meaning." Goepp says, "Haydn's scherzos
always have a strong 'out of school' feeling,
this one especially; only it is a short recess."
Haydn and Beethoven were the only true musical
humorists. 
<h4>739 Finale, Vivace, Symphony in D (Clock Symphony)</h4>
Again we are constrained to quote Philip H. 

Goepp:
<p>

"Strange to say, the Finale (marked Vivace) 

is quite the most serious phase of the symphony. 

Recess is quite over; we are back in school not
to say church-for the violins, like a well trained
choir, are striking up a melody that
sounds much like a good old chorale.
<p>
"Simply stated, without a note of extended
cadence, it is strictly repeated as if to make sure
we know it. It is like the preacher who states
his text with all serious unction, and repeats it,
to give warning of the great sermon which is to
follow. We are sure it is a rondo, mainly because
it is not sonata-form; the cardinal theme,
in its constant rounds, never lets us forget the
text of the sermon. After some playing of
themal phrases, there comes one of those dynamic
passages, where all join to make a noise,
and finally drop exhausted into a cadence;
whereupon the strings, with a little help from
the woods, gently toss about snatches of the
melody, and the rest pitch in again in general
turbulence. At last the strings rehearse the 
theme in really serious manner, with but slight
obligato variation. The rest, too, join properly
and respectfully in singing the hymn in its
original harmonies. Soon comes another of
those terrible phases, another Minore, where
Papa Haydn tries so hard to look fierce, without
anything special to say; merely general muttering,
with the same old faces. We all know it is
only to break the more pleasantly into his own
benignant smile.
<p>
"Here was the fugue, which we knew was coming
from the emphatic way the theme was first
enounced. With such a theme, it could not be
resisted. It begins in the first violins, with the
seconds tripping in obligato behind, before, and
all around, until they finally take up the theme,
and. the violas 'hold the candle.' Best of all is
when the 'cellos come in and the rest all play
about. Of course, the violas have their turn, too.
Finally, the woods make a trial at the theme,
while the violins go on without attending to their
ineffective attempts, and finally run away from
them, on a side path. At last the whole orchestra
joins in the fugue with all possible magnificence
and solemnity, until the last verse, which is sung
once more as at first." 
<h4>729 Adagio, Vivace</h4>
<h4>730 Andante</h4>
<h4>731 Minuetto</h4>
<h4>732 Finale, Allegro Molto</h4>
The four rolls enumerated above comprise the
G major, popularly known as "The Surprise."
It is Number 8 of a set of twelve written for
Salomon of London, but Number 6 of the Breitkopf
and Hartel and other standard editions.
It was written in 1791. The usual short Adagio
is used as an introduction, leading up to the
first theme (Vivace) in 6-8 time. The theme is
as dainty as could be in the beginning, but soon
takes on a more important air and develops into
a masterful piece of writing.
<p>
It is from the Andante, or slow movement of
the symphony, that it gets its name "Surprise."
It starts out most unostentatiously, the theme
being the single notes of the tonic and dominant
seventh chords, accompanied only by a single
bass note. It is first played piano, then repeated
pianissimo. At the end of the repetition, there
is a sudden and unexpected crash of the whole
orchestra.
<p>
Papa Haydn always loved his joke, and he said
to a iriend when writing this movement, "That's
sure to make the ladies jump." It has never 

failed to this day.
<p> 

The plan of the Andante is that of a theme and 

variations of which he was so fond.
<p>

The Minuetto is in Haydn's inimitable style.
In the Finale, we find Haydn in his happiest
vein. He revels in the sort of theme he has
selected. It seems almost mischievous--as
though he were playing pranks on the players
by making them chase each other all over the
place. He has serious moments, however, and
has introduced some very surprising harmonies
in the latter half of the movement, also a rhythmic
surprise in the use (twice) of a grand pause,
or full measure rest.
<h3>HERBERT, Victor</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>692 Kiss Me Again (Waltz)</h4>
This is one of the old favorites which bobs up
every now and again and has a period of popularity
which makes some of the new things in
the way of popular music suffer by comparison.
It is played and sung on the vaudeville stage
perhaps more than any other single composition,
and it always makes a hit. It seems to
have become a necessity. 
<h3>HIRSCH, Louis A.</h3>
Few, if any, composera of popular music are better
known, or have been more successful, than Louis A.
Hirsch. His success would seem to refute the idea that
a man with a claaaical education cannot write popular
music.
<p>
Hirsch was educated abroad, having studied piano
with Guatave Levy and Rafael Joseffy in Berlin. He
studied theory with Max Spicker in New York.
<p>
Among the many musical shows written by him were
"Going Up," "Vera Violetta," "The Rainbow Girl,"
etc. His greatest success is "Mary," and it is by all
odds the most popular musical comedy produced in years.
<h4>554 The Love Nest</h4>
This is by far the most popular song written for
many years. It stands a good chance of outselling
any song of any time. It is from
"Mary," a musical comedy recently produced
in New York, and by three separate road companies.
The reason for its unusual popularity
is not hard to discover, for it has real musical
merit, as well as that elusive something that
makes one whistle or sing it continuously.
<h4>698 Learn to Smile,from "The O'Brien Girl"</h4>
A production with bright prospects for a long
run is "The O'Brien Girl." It has captured
the popular fancy and is a genuine hit. The
tune that you take home is "Learn to Smile," a 
most fascinating thing which is whistled and
sung for days after its first hearing.
<p>
We have arranged it for the organ in true
theatrical fashion for those who like to dance.
<h3>HOGAN, Parke V. 1868-</h3>
Born in Mount Holly, N. J., May 6, 1868. Studied
organ with the celebrated blind organist, David D.
Wood of Philadelphia. Completed his studies of music
and theory at the Philadelphia Musical Academy.
Has been a successful conductor of chorus, orchestra
and light opera. Has written many songs and has
as well composed a light opera. Our patrons will
be interested in a composition from his pen, as it is
well known that he has for several years been the
guiding hand in the arrangement of music for the
Estey Residence Organ.
<h4>429 Minuet in D Minor</h4>
This is an adaptation of a minuet from a string
quartette. The first strain is a rather robust
and vigorous theme in D minor. The trio starts
in D major but restlessly wanders about among
related keys making very short calls and returning
home in time for the da capo. As with all
minuets the first two strains are played again,
finishing on the common chord of D major.
The advent of the F sharp in the final chord is
rather startling, but leaves a good taste in one's
mouth.
<h3>HOLLINS, Alfred 1865-</h3>
This famous organist and composer was born blind. 

He studied first with relatives, then at the Wilberforce
Institute for the Blind. In 1878 he entered the 

Royal Normal College for the blind at Upper Norwood,
where he studied piano with Hartvigson, and 

organ with Dr. Hopkins. He studied later with von 

Bulow in Berlin.
<p> 

At thirteen he played Beethoven's Emperor Concerto 

at Crystal Palace.
<p> 

In 1886, under the guidance of Dr. Campbell of the 

Normal College, he and a quartette of blind players 

toured America. He visited America again in 1886. 

and Australia in 1904.
<p>

His compositions include two concert overtures and 

numerous other pieces for organ, a romance for violin
and piano, several anthems, piano pieces, etc., all 

of which bear the stamp of the true musician. 

<h4>449 Spring Song</h4>
Rarely does one find a more charming bit of
writing for the organ than this Spring Song.
The spirit of spring permeates it from beginning
to end. Birds, buds, flowers, sunshine--all
the beauties of spring are to be found in this
exquisite composition, which is delightful in its
joyous and buoyant mood. 
<h4>451 Concert Overture in C Minor</h4>
The composer of this overture is one of the best known
composers for the organ. He is largely
known, however, for his works in the smaller
forms such as are usually written for church
service. In this case he has given his talents a
free rein and has produced a number for concert
use which is not only interesting but delightful
from beginning to end. The work is
interesting in theme and his thematic material
is developed in the masterful way characteristic
of the composer. In this instance he had much
to say, and said it in a most fascinating manner.
<h4>687 Cantilene in A flat</h4>
An introduction of six measures serves to establish
the rhythm chosen for this composition.
The theme is one of great beauty and simplicity
and the message it brings is one of refined sentiment.
It is one of those rare things which gives
us more than we hear--that suggests beautiful
thought. After all, this is the great mission of music.
<h4>691 Romanza</h4>
This is a charming melody of the type and
quality to be expected from Hollins. The 
theme is one of delightful simplicity and grace
in G major. A second theme in contrasting
rhythm, in the key of G minor, precludes any
possibility of monotony. Now comes a most
skillful development of the two themes together.
The second theme in G minor has been turned
into a major theme and used as a counterpoint
to the first theme in most clever fashion. It is
a most interesting bit of writing and one which
improves on acquaintance.
<h4>693 Evening Rest</h4>
Tranquillity is the text of this dainty musical
discourse. It is Hollins in his best and most
peaceful mood. The accompaniment of the first
part is in sustained chords with a moving figure
in the pedal suggesting the plucked strings of
the basses in an orchestra. After the first verse,
as it were, the theme is immediately repeated an
octave higher. This time the sustained chords
give way to a broken chord harplike accompaniment,
the pedal figure remaining the same.
Now comes a theme of a totally different character,
forming a splendid contrast with the first
theme. Then, in all its simplicity, the original
theme is heard again, a short coda bringing to
a close a very beautiful bit of music. 
<h3>JACOBI, Victor</h3>
<h4>482 On Miami Shore</h4>
This is a very good example of the present-day
waltz, which has become exceedingly popular.
For dance purposes this roll leaves nothing to
be desired.
<h3>JARNEFELT, Armas 1869-</h3>
The subject of this paragraph is a Finnish composer,
born in Wiborg, Finland, August, 1869. He studied
with Wegelius and Busoni at the Helsingfors Conservatoire,
then with Becker in Berlin and Massenet in
Paris. He has composed a great deal considering his
activities as a conductor, and his compositions include
two overtures, four orchestral suites, and a symphonic
poem. Besides thesc works in the larger forms, he has
written numerous songs and choruses. Since 1907 he
has been conductor of the Royal Opera at Copenhagen.
<h4>439 Praeludium</h4>
This is a sprightly little thing which is overflowing
with good workmanship. It is not startling
either in thematic material or harmonic structure.
Much charm attaches to it, however, because
of the superlative skill with which the
chosen material is treated. 
<h4>565 Berceuse</h4>
A gem of the first water is this little piece. It
is useless to attempt to describe it, for it is one
of those things which conclusively prove the
futility of any attempt to translate the language
of music into terms of mere words.
<h3>JOHNSTON, Edward F. 1879-</h3>
This sterling musician was born in Edinburgh. He
received his education at the Edinburgh University,
and studied music there with Professor Niecks. He
also studied with Professor Laudi at the Academy of
Music at Florence.
<p>
Some very important positions have been capably
filled by Mr. Johnston, whose reputation is firmly
established as a performer, as well as a composer.
His compositions include three comic operas, many
sacred and secular songs, and a number of pieces for
the piano and organ, his works for the organ being
e8pecially well known.
<h4>370 Evensong</h4>
This charming number was first conceived as a
sentimental song, but never fulfilled its original
purpose. A number of years elapsed between
the first conception and the appearance of the
piece in the form known to the public. 
The first theme has in it that something which
refuses to remain in obscurity. It was known
to a few of Mr. Johnston's friends and was a
theme upon which he liked to improvise. He
resolved to elaborate it and give it definite form,
and the result is one of the most delightful of
organ pieces, and a wonderful favorite.
It is good music, and the present roll gives it in
a manner gratifying to the most exacting ear.
<h3>JOLSON, Al, and ROSE, Vincent</h3>
<h4>560 Avalon</h4>
<h3>JONGEN, Joseph 1873-</h3>
Jongen is a well-known Belgian composer who was
born at Liege, December 14, 1873. He studied at the
Conservatoire in Liege and won many prizes with his
compositions, including the Prix de Rome for his cantata
"Comala." He has composed in all forms-from
pieces for the harmonium to a symphonic poem.
<p>
He is a composer of distinctly modern tendencies, indeed
he may be said to belong to the modern French
school. 
<h4>538 Chant de May</h4>
This is a delightful bit of distinctly modem
music. It is very indefinite in form and savors
somewhat of a charming improvisation. Debussy
might have composed it, which is all that
need be said of its quality.
<h4>590 Improvisation-Caprice</h4>
Here is a most interesting composition by one
of the ultramoderns. There are spots in it that
hardly sound as though they had been improvised-indeed,
they give the impression of being
the result of serious study, but it is a caprice
from beginning to end-never anything else.
It is a distinctly modem conception, and a
charming one.
<h3>KARG-ELERT, Siegfried 1879-</h3>
Karg-Elert was born at Oberndorf, Wurttemberg,
November 21, 1879. He studied at the Leipsic Conservatoire
under Reinecke, Reisenauer, Jadassohn and
others. He is a most indefatigable composer of emtreme
modern tendtmcies. He has written much for
the organ.
<h4>542 Salvation Has Come To Us</h4>
This is a very beautiful and very short number
which is one of the twenty choral studies published
as Op. 78. The German title, of which
the above is a free translation, is Es ist das Heil
uns kommen her.
<h4>591 La Nuit, Op. 72, No.3</h4>
<h4>592 Clair de Lune, Op. 72, No.2</h4>
Here are two numbers from a group of three
pieces for organ entitled "Trois Impressions."
They were dedicated to Alexander Guilmant
and are excellent examples of the work of this
German composer. In calling these "impressions"
Karg-Elert seems to have hit upon a very
happy title. They are much like an impressionistic
painting. Correct perspective is essential if
one would enjoy them to the utmost. They seem
queer at first hearing, but improve on acquaintance.
<h3>KERN, Jerome David 1885-</h3>
There is no more successful composer of popular
music of a high class than Jerome Kern, who was born
in New York, January 27, 1885. He was educated
in the public schools of New York and Newark, N. J.,
and at Hunter College. He studied music at the New
York College of Music. He has been phenomenally
successful as a composer of theatrical music, all of
which is far above the average.
<h4>697 Look for the Silver Lining, from "Sally"</h4>
"Sally" is one of the big hits. It has been running
more than a year. The song "Look for the
Silver Lining" is the musical hit of the show.
It is a bit of optimism which should be practiced.
Aside from the lesson, it is a catchy tune
which is worthy of a hearing. The organ does
it splendidly.
<h4>700 Ka-Lu-A</h4>
This is one of the hits from "Good Morning,
Dearie," which is more than holding its own on
the New York stage just now. It has an Oriental
flavor of a much better quality than most
things of the sort. The composer seems to have
the faculty of producing music which has a
popular appeal without descending to the commonplace
level. His writings are always tuneful-never
cheap or vulgar.
<h3>KINDER, Ralph</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>424 Caprice</h4>
Here is a caprice that is capricious. It scintillates
from beginning to end, and continuously
does what is least expected-as a caprice should.
It has a very interesting middle part in 5-4
time which adds to its whimsical character, after
which the inconstant first theme recurs, bringing
to an end a most fanciful conceit.
<h4>442 Serenade</h4>
A number from the pen of Kinder is always
well worth a hearing. He is one of the best known
organists and composers in this country
and his works enjoy commendation from both
player and listener. This Serenade is no exception.
It reveals Kinder's gift of melody,
which seems unending, and some clever workmanship
also. It was written for the organ,
which fact assures a satisfactory rendition by
the roll. 
<h3>KREISLER, Fritz</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volwme 1)
<h4>367 Liebesfreud</h4>
This is another of these wonderful arrangements
of folk songs so inimitably done by Kreisler,
and known so well through his playing. It is
an old Vienna waltz-very old-but under
Kreisler's magic touch it has become new. It
has lost none of its quaintness, however, through
its revivification.
<p>
The organ gives it in a manner second only to
Kreisler's violin.
<h3>LANGER, G.</h3>
<h4>716 Grandma (Grossmutterchen), Op.20</h4>
This fine old tune is a Landler or Laendler,
which is a dance tune popular in Austria, Bavaria,
Bohemia and Styria. The dance is said
to have originated in Landel, from which district
it derives its name.
<p>
It is in 3-4 time like a waltz, but the tempo is
much slower and more stately. Mozart and
Beethoven have both written true Landler, but
many of the so-named compositions of later 
writers have nothing in common with the genuine.
Schubert has also written most beauti

fully in this form.
<p> 

The composer of the Landler which we have 

recorded has written many. The present one 

is a fair sample. 

<h3>LEFEBURE-WELY, Louis J. Alfred</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>473 Offertoire in C</h4>
An offertoire is a piece popularly supposed to
furnish a suitable accompaniment to the taking
up of the offering in a church service. We have
here a most interesting composition. It is full
of delightful contrasts both in theme and registration.
<h3>LEMARE, Edwin H.</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue. Volume 1)
<h4>443 Gavotte a la Cour</h4>
In this gavotte, Lemare has retained all the peculiar
rhythmical qualities of this old dance tune.
Of all the dance rhythms of a century or two 
ago, the gavotte and minuet alone retain their
popularity, and these have survived because of
their real worth. All composers have felt the
love of this fascinating rhythm and many have
found it a most useful form for the expression
of their musical feelings. Lemare is no exception
in this respect. He has treated the form
rather more freely than most composers do, but
he is a master workman and the form has suffered
none as the result.
<h4>445 Chanson d'Ete</h4>
Spring songs we have in abundance but the
thought of writing a song to summer seems to
have occurred to few composers. This prodigious
composer must have often been at his wits'
end for names for his compositions. He has
written in all the recognized forms, and, not
content with the children of his own brain, he
has adopted very many of the classic works and
adapted them to the instrument of his choice.
In this song he is in a happy mood and it seems
that the title is particularly apt.
<h4>479 Serenade</h4>
Andante Grazioso is the tempo indication given
for this little serenade, which is one of three 
numbers collectively called an Arcadian Idyll.
Graceful is the proper adjective, for the theme
jumps about with almost feline grace, among
the most appropriate harmonies. A very pretty
development of the theme in canon form is used
for a middle part, after which the subject reappears
in its original form.
<h4>489 Morning Serenade "In California"</h4>
This serenade is much in the nature of a popular
song-in a lighter and more frivolous vein
than most of Lemare's work. The same good
workmanship common to this composer is present,
and it is a composition of real beauty.
<h3>LEMMENS, Nicholas Jaques</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>469 Scherzo Symphonic</h4>
This is an orthodox scherzo but is conceived in
symphonic proportions. Lemmens was a master
workman and in this Scherzo he has been
fortunate in the choice of thematic material
which permitted him to display his technique of
composition. It was written for the organ, and
the roll renders it in a manner lacking no esseniial
either in registration or technique.
<h4>471 March Triomphale</h4>
The march form is always an interesting one.
Many of the great composers have written nothing
that endears them to the people to a greater
extent than their marches. In corroboration
of this statement the Mendelssohn "Wedding
March"; "Bridal March from Lohengrin,"
Wagner; "March from Aida, Verdi; "Coronation
March from The Prophet," Meyerbeer;
"Funeral March;" Chopin; and many others
might be mentioned.
<p>
The march should be a composition of much
dignity and breadth, and a composer lacking
these qualities had better confine his, efforts to
some other form. It should always be stately never
maudlin or sentimental.
<p>
Lemmens possessed all the qualities necessary
to write a fine march and has done it in this
March Triomphale. 

<h3>LEUPOLD, A. W.</h3>
<h4>569 Ecce Homo, Op. 15 C</h4>
This is indeed a very fine composition by the
organist of St. Peter's, Berlin. It is distinctly
of the German school, and is full of remarkably
ingenious transitions. It never startles, but it
is full of pleasant surprises. It is organ music
in its strictest and best sense.
<h3>LIDDLE, S.</h3>
<h4>417 Abide with Me</h4>
Here is a song that one can become really enthusiastic
about. The words are inseparably welded
to the hymn tune, "Eventide," of course, but
their consummate beauty has, notwithstanding
this fact, tempted the muse of many a mortal
without eliciting more than passing comment.
This particular setting is the exception. It is a
song of rare beauty and so singable as to be difficult
to render it badly. It is dignified and reverent,
and next to the beautiful hymn tune, to
which the poem really belongs, it is probably the
most satisfactory setting the words have had. 
<h3>LINCKE, Paul 1866-</h3>
Lincke is a well-known composer of light music for
orchestra. and popular songs. He was born in Berlin,
November 7, 1866. In America his gavotte, the "Glow
Worm," is the best known of any of his efforts. He
is also engaged in the music publishing business.
<h4>426 The Glow Worm-Gavotte</h4>
This is a graceful dance which was made popular
largely through the terpsichorean efforts of the
celebrated Russian dancer, Madame Pavlowa.
It is a very general favorite wherever music of
this sort is in demand, and it has real merit. The
roll gives it in a very satisfactory manner.
<h3>MacDOWELL, Edward Alexander</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume l)
<h4>639 Romance, Op. 39, No.3, A Sea Song, Op. 55, No. 5, By Smouldering Embers, Op.61, No.6</h4>
<h4>640 Starlight, Op. 55, No. 4, At an Old Trysting Place, Op. 51, No.3, A Deserted Farm, Op. 51, No.8</h4>
We have selected for these two rolls, six of MacDowell's
most beautiful miniatures. Each one
is as beautiful as a cameo, and as wonderful a
work of art. MacDowell stands alone among
the moderns in the writing of such fragments,
as did Schumann among the classics. He was
the victim of every emotion, and most of them he
has most cleverly depicted through the indefinite
medium of sound. These six little things are
gems of the first water. Their native charm has
been added to, and nothing has been lost by their
adaptation to the organ.
<h3>MacFARLANE, Will C.</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>458 Spring Song</h4>
Here is an enchanting bit of writing which
measures up to all that might be expected of a
spring song. It is as bright as a spring day. 
The twitter and trill of the birds are here, and
the fragrance of flowers-indeed, it would be
difficult to find a more charming musical depiction
of the joys of the spring season.
<h4>531 Serenade</h4>
There is nothing of the commonplace in this
Serenade. It is not the Spanish type with the
tinkle of the guitar, but seems to be cast in a
new mould. Whatever of innovation there is in
it, is all to its betterment. After a vague and
mysterious introduction of four measures, and
a like number of accompaniment, which serve
to establish the time and rhythm, begins a
charming melody of distinctly modern flavor.
A pretty middle part by two solo voices and of
a different design, furnishes the necessary contrast,
and the first theme, with a coda of eight
measures, brings to a close a most charming roll.
<h3>MAILLY, Alphonse Jean Ernest 1833-</h3>
Belgium has been the birthplace of many great musicians,
few of whom have excelled the subject of this
paragraph. He waa born in Brussels, November 27, 1833.
He became a pianist of renown, and then an
organ virtuoso. At the Brussels Conservatoire, where
he obtained his musical education, he was appointed
piano teacher in 1861, and organ teacher in 1868.
His works include sonatas, fantasies and all the larger
organ forms, as well as pieces for various combinations
of instruments in the smaller forms.
<h4>706 Invocation</h4>
A more devotional or reverential piece than
this invocation is not to be found. It breathes
the spirit of supplication. No instrument but
the organ could do it justice. By all means hear it.
<h3>MATTHEWS, Harry Alexander 1879-</h3>
Harry Alexander Matthews, one of the best-known organists
and composers among the younger set, was
born in Cheltenham, England, March 26, 1879. He
studied music with his father, who was a well-known
organist and conductor. For a number of years he
has been in Philadelphia, where his musical ability and
likable nature have won him a host of friends and admirers.
He has written no less than five cantatas, all
of which have been published and are successful. Besides
these choral works he has written many things
for the organ, numerous songs and part songs, and
many anthems. He is at present organiat and choirmaster
at St. Luke's Church, Philadelphia. 
<h4>468 To Spring</h4>
The composer calls this a caprice for organ, and
it is capricious enough to suit the most exacting.
The principal theme is the call of the wood
robin, and this queer little phrase is developed
in a delightful and masterful manner. Its title,
"To Spring," is a very happy one.
<h4>477 Cantilene</h4>
Cantilene is a term applied to a melody of a
singable nature. The organ, being readily susceptible
to melodies of this character, has received
more attention in this direction than any
other instrument. Indeed, no one would think
nowadays of writing a cantilene for anything else.
<p>
The term is aptly applied in the case of this
number. It is a smooth, easy-flowing melody of
bewitching beauty. At first the theme appears
with the simplest possible accompaniment, and,
after a middle part, recurs with a counter theme,
snatches of which have been heard in the introduction
and at various other times, adding a
finishing touch which is exceedingly appropriate
and interesting. 
<h4>580 Pastorale</h4>
H. Alexander Matthews has written many more
pretentious things for the organ than this Pastorale,
but he has written little-pretentious or
otherwise-into which he has crowded more real
beauty. It is simple in the extreme, but delightful
in its simplicity.
<h4>581 Caprice</h4>
We wonder if a musical caprice might be described
as a "tune out for a walk." We think so,
and we think also that this dainty little composition
proves our case. It starts out for nowhere
in particular and seems to arrive at no prearranged
destination. Here it runs, there it
walks, and occasionally it stops-as if to look
around. Then on it goes, wandering aimlessly
about until it is time to return home, the last
part of the trip being down the same street it
started out upon; and a pleasant walk it was.
<h4>621 Paean</h4>
We have made rolls of a number of compositions
by Harry Alexander Matthews, all of
which have received approbation from the 
owners of Estey Organs. This Paean is rather
more pretentious than the others, and it reveals
a broader technique in composition than any of
the others. It is splendid music and worthy of
a studious hearing. The first theme is big in
conception and pompous-as it should be. The
second theme is quiet and in beautiful contrast.
Both themes are developed in a rather free
manner. A free fugal passage built upon the
first theme leads cleverly into a return of the
second theme in a different key, after which the
first theme recurs and is brilliantly treated for a
close.
<h3>MEALE, J. A.</h3>
<h4>457 The Magic Harp</h4>
This is a pedal study with a harp accompaniment,
and is designed to display a facile pedal
technique as well as a variety of tone color. It
fulfills its purpose in a charming way and is a
very delectable composition. It will be of especial
interest to those who have an organ containing
the Estey concert harp. 
<h3>MENDELSSOHN-BARTHOLDI, Jakob Ludwig Felix</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>379 Concerto for Violin, Op. 64, Second Movement, Andante</h4>
This is a song for the violin. It has no words.
Words could not, indeed, express the message
it brings. In this style of writing Mendelssohn
has no competitor. Everything he has done of
this kind seems to be a reflection of his beautiful
character.
<p>
Kindliness, patience-what virtue is lacking in
his melodies! Let it tell its own story.
<h4>382 Italian Symphony, First Movement</h4>
The name of this composition would seem to
indicate that it was written during the composer's
visit to Italy in 1830. It was undoubtedly
conceived in Italy, and perhaps moulded
into a more or less definite form in his mind
while there, but was not reduced to paper until
1833. On November 5, 1832, the Philharmonic
Society of London passed a resolution asking
Mendelssohn to compose a symphony, an overture
and a vocal number, and offering him one
hundred guineas for the exclusive right of performance
for two years. The Italian Symphony
was to be one of the three and it bears the
date, Berlin, March 13, 1833.
<p>
The work as a whole is characteristic, spontaneous
and graceful, and would seem to have
been easily written. Mendelssohn's notes concerning
its composition, however, would lead to
a different conclusion. He wrote, "The bitterest
moments I ever endured, or could have
imagined, were those I experienced during the
autumn when the work was in progress."
Later, when the work was finished, he found joy
in the fact that the work "pleases me and shows
progress."
<p>
Mendelssohn was his own most exacting critic
and in this case, as in all others, that which
pleased him has stood the test of time, which
can never dim the lustre of this brilliant work.
<h4>385 Saltarello, Finale of Italian Symphony</h4>
This dance form, which dates back to the sixteenth
century, has been variously known as
Nachtanz, Proportio, Hoppeltanz and Saltarello,
the first three being German and the
last the Italian name for the same thing.
<p>
Mendelssohn gracefully avoided an incongruity
by choosing the Italian name for his Italian
Symphony. Rare good humor permeates this
entire movement which has two themes in which
the jumping or hopping step is very apparent
(Latin, Saltare, to jump), and a third which
belongs to another dance form, the tarantella,
which is strictly of Italian origin.
<p>
The three themes are amalgamated in thoroughly
Mendelssohnian fashion and the result
is an exceedingly charming number.
<h4>386 First Movement, Scotch 
Symphony</h4>
This work is one of five, including, in addition
to the Symphony, an overture, two fantasies
for piano and a two-part song, in which the
composer recorded the impressions of his Scotch
tour in 1829.
The present movement opens with a delightful
Andante, the subject of which bears the date,
July 30, 1829.
<p>
The Symphony was planned during Mendelssohn's
visit to Italy in 1831, and partially written
there, but was not completed until January
20, 1842, which date the finished score bears.
It had its premier performance at Leipsic on
March 3rd of the same year. Mendelssohn took
it to England in 1842, and conducted it at a
Philharmonic Concert, receiving permission to
dedicate it to Queen Victoria.
<h4>430 Allegro con Moto, Op. 18</h4>
Mendelssohn, very early in life, showed his fondness
for stringed instruments. Even after he
had tasted success as a composer of larger works,
such as oratorios and symphonies, he found time
to devote to string quartettes, etc.
<p>
The present number was written in 1831 and
was the first of his two string quintettes. The
key is A major and it is full of Mendelssohnian
delicacy and charm. Mendelssohn enjoyed a
very happy existence, and his writings unmistakably
reflect his jovial nature. He was nearly
always joyous and light-hearted-he must have
been, for his music betrays him. Verily, in his
most dramatic moments he was happily so.
<p>
The roll gives this number with all the freshness
and charm of a quintette of strings, and in the
tone color selected by Mendelssohn for its setting,
for no stops are used except strings. 
<h4>529 Ruy Blas Overture</h4>
"Ruy Blas" is a play by Victor Hugo. In 1839
Mendelssohn was asked to write something to
be performed at a concert to be given for the
benefit of the Widows' Fund of the Gewandhaus
Orchestra. He wrote for the occasion the
Ruy Blas Overture and a chorus for soprano
voices and orchestra. In a letter to his mother,
dated March 18, 1839, he informs her that he
conceived, wrote, copied, rehearsed and executed
both pieces between Tuesday evening and
Friday morning, and that a great part of
Wednesday and Thursday were otherwise occupied.
This almost or quite matches some of
the feats of Handel and a few others. It is a
brilliant overture and truly Mendelssohnian.
<h4>622 Overture, Fair Melusina</h4>
This is a concert overture and it may be well to
record here the story of the fairy who prompted
it:
<p>
"A daughter of the fairy, Pressina, by Elenas,
king of Albania, the most renowned of the
French fairies. Her origin may be traced to
the Teutonic 'Amalaswinth! She was condemned
to become every Saturday a serpent
from the waist downward, as a punishment for
having, by means of a charm, inclosed her
father in a high mountain, in order to avenge an
injury her mother had received from him. She
married Raymond, Count of Poitiers, and,
having been seen by him during her loathsome
transformation, was immured in a subterranean
dungeon of the Castle of Lusignan. The traditions
concerning Melusina were collected by
Jean d'Arras, near the close of the fourteenth
century."
<p>
The Melusine tradition lingers around the
Castle of Lusignan, near Poitiers, and to this
day, at the fairs of that city, gingerbread cakes
are sold with human head and serpent tail, and
called Melusines. A "cri de Melusine" is likewise
a proverbial expression for a sudden
scream, recalling that with which the unfortunate
fairy discovered the indiscretion of her lord.
<h4>624 Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage</h4>
Two of Goethe's poems furnished the inspiration
for this overture, namely, "Meer Still"
(calm sea) and "Gluckliche Fahrt" (happy, or
prosperous voyage). It was written when
Mendelssohn was very young-about nineteen
-and was, according to his sister Fanny, not
originally intended that the two movements
should be played as an overture, but as two
separate tone poems. Some years afterward
Mendelssohn rewrote it and a letter written by
him indicates that he considered it much improved
and that he was quite satisfied with it.
The first movement represents the calm sea, the
second the prosperous voyage. Both parts are
fully up to the Mendelssohnian standard.
<h4>629 Overture, Fingal's Cave</h4>
This overture has two other names-"Die Hebriden"
and "Die einsame Insel." It is best
known in this country, however, as Fingal's
Cave. It is the second of Mendelssohn's concert
overtures. It was begun in 1829 while on
a visit to Staffa, and completed in Rome in
1830, the first score bearing the date of Rome,
December 16, 1830. A second score bears the
date, London, June 20, 1832. The two scores
differ materially in parts. The present roll
gives the accepted form. It was first played
by the Philharmonic Society in London, May 14, 1832. 
<h4>667 I Would That My Love</h4>
It is probable that there have heen many
settings of Heine's "Ich Wollt' Meine Lieb,"
but it is safe to assume that none of them is so
beautiful as this one by Mendelssohn. Never
was there a composer with a greater gift of
melody than Mendelssohn. His melodies all
bear the stamp of refinement. They reflect the
fine texture of his being. Here he found a
theme much to his liking and the result is, to
quote Moore, "like the faint exquisite music
of a dream."
<h4>734 Intermezzo, Midsummer Night's Dream</h4>
This Intermezzo is Number 2 of the series of
twelve numbers of incidental music written by
Mendelssohn to the Shakesperian play. Of the
instrumental numbers, we have already listed
the Wedding March, Scherzo, Nocturne and
Overture. The Intermezzo is in Mendelssohn's
happiest vein.
<h3>MERKEL, Gustav 1827-1885</h3>
This famous composer for the organ was born in
Oberoderwitz, Saxony, November 12, 1827. His musical
education was received from Julius Otto; the eminent
organist, Johann Schneider of Dresden; Reissiger;
and Schumann. From 1861 he was professor
of the organ at the Dresden Conservatorium. He has
written in all the large forms for organ and his works
are all of a very high order of excellence. He was a
master of form, and his writings for the organ are
considered the most valuable.
<h4>638 Introduction and Fugue</h4>
This is a sturdy composition for the organ. It
is dignified and scholarly. It is the work of a
master, and must be heard a number of times
for you to get its full meaning. It is well worth
the effort required to fathom it.
<h3>MIGNAN, Edouard</h3>
<h4>578 Pastorale</h4>
Here is a quaint little melody which is sung first
on the oboe. An enchanting middle part as a
chorus of strings, then flutes and strings, furnishes
a splendid contrast to the first theme,
which now reappears as a flute solo, finishing
with a passage on the violin which is reminiscent
of the first theme. It is of the French school
and a dainty bit indeed. 
<h3>MILLER, Russell King 1871-</h3>
This well-known composer was born in Philadelphia,
and his musical activities have been largely confined
to his home city. His light has not, however, been
hidden under a bushel, for he is one of the best-known
American composers. He was educated at Princeton
University, studied piano with Constantin von Sternberg
and Xaver Scharwenka, and composition with
Philipp Scharwenka and Bruno Oscar Klein.
<p>
Among the best-known compositions by this sterling
composer are the "Nocturne" and "Epilogue," but
many others enjoy the popularity they well deserve.
<h4>378 Nocturne</h4>
This is a most delightful number of purely
organ music. It is a favorite on recital programmes
throughout the country, and well deserves
the esteem it enjoys.
<p>
The roll does it full justice, and much pleasure
is in store for those who avail themselves of its use.
<h4>460 Epilogue</h4>
This composition, as its name would indicate,
was designed to play people out of church.
There is a well-known story to the effect that
when Mendelssohn played the organ in church 
the people refused to leave. We have a suspicion
that if this epilogue were as well played
in church as the roll plays it, a similar result
would be produced. It is a fine thing, which reveals
in every measure the fine musicianship of the composer.
<h4>472 Scherzo Symphonic</h4>
A full-grown scherzo when written for the organ
is very generally and very aptly termed a
"Scherzo Symphonic." Here is a scherzo that
is good in theme and splendid in workmanship.
Most of Miller's work for organ is big in conception,
and this number is characteristic in that
respect, but is never top-heavy or uninteresting.
This is an altogether delightful composition.
<h4>699 Berceuse</h4>
Little has been published from the pen of this
well-known organist, but that little is of sterling
quality. Here is a berceuse which seems to have
been written to fit its title. It is a charming
little composition, which bears the stamp of its
author. It is in the usual form, but very unusual
in quality. 
<h3>MOSZKOWSKI, Moritz</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch Bee Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>380 Spanish Dances, Op. 12, Nos. 1 and 4</h4>
This roll contains two numbers of a justly
famous set of Spanish dances written for piano,
four hands. They are both characteristic of
this composer's brilliant style and are given on
the organ in a highly satisfactory way.
<h4>381 Spanish Dance, Op. 12, No.2</h4>
This is, to many, the most interesting dance of
this set of five. It begins with a theme in a
minor key-a theme more than ordinarily susceptible
to a tempo rubato which is nothing short of bewitching.
<p>
The second part is distinctly Spanish, the accompaniment
suggesting unmistakably the click
of castanets. A third theme asserts itself in
brilliant fashion, and a return to the first closes
a very charming number.
<h4>415 Melodie, Op. 77, No. 9</h4>
Versatility combined with great talent is a combination
seldom found in these days of specialization,
and it is no less rare in a composition than
along other lines.
<p>
Moszkowski is at home in any form which his
fancy may dictate, from the most complex and
difficult piano concerto, to the simplest melody.
In every case the result betrays the breadth of
his art. The tunes which will stand absolutely
alone-those which require no clothing of accompaniment-are
few; so few as to be counted
upon the fingers. They are almost without exception,
national airs, and the fact that they
will, and do, stand alone as tunes only, is the
best proof of their greatness. True examples
of unadorned beauty!
<p>
Next comes the tune which requires but little
support, and such a one we have in the present
roll. It is a little gem which requires no elaborate
setting to bring out its beauty-just
enough to enable it to be viewed in the proper light.
<h4>425 Berceuse</h4>
Music's soporific qualities have long been recognized
if not understood. Anyone in doubt concerning
this phenomenon may readily be convinced by
attending a symphony concert, where 
a casual glance will reveal many should-be auditors
either on the verge of, or entirely in, the land
of forgetfulness. A conductor bold enough to
deliberately place upon his programme a slumber
song would be an oddity. He would, however,
without hesitation playa scherzo, fantasie
or humoresque-simply because of a name when
any one of them would be likely in some
cases to produce a degree of somnolence approaching
coma. As a means of identification,
names are useful, much more cannot be expected
of them--especially in music.
At any rate, here is a seductive little berceuse
guaranteed to rouse the most lethargic.
<h3>MOTZAN, Otto, and CONRAD, Con</h3>
<h4>712 Mandy 'n' Me (Fox Trot)</h4>
This is another of the popular dance tunes
which we have put on the roll for the enjoyment
of our clients who like to dance. "Mandy 'n'
Me" just at this time is enjoying a degree of
popularity which comes to few dance tunes. It
has a bewitching rhythm and a catchy melody. 
<h3>MOUSSORGSKY, Modest Petrovitch 1835-1881</h3>
This eminent composer was born in Karev, Russia,
March 28, 1835. He received his firat instruction from
his mother on the piano and made very rapid progress.
He entered the Military Academy at Petrograd, from
which he graduated in 1856, and with no thought of
adopting music as a profession. His talent, however,
was discovered by Cui and Balakirev, who persuaded
him to devote himself to music exclusively. He began
a course of study, unassisted, and acquired a good
technique of composition, but poverty made it necessary
for him to accept an uncongenial position in the
government service, which he held through life.
<p>
His compositions are limited in number, but of exquisite
quality - especially his songs. His opera, "Boris
Godunow" has found a place in the repertoire of all
the principal opera houses, and has firmly edablished
his reputation as a compoler. He died March 28, 1881.
<h4>574 A Tear</h4>
This is an exquisite little conceit which could
only have been written by a man of fine temperament.
It is sad, but not gloomy or lugubrious.
What is more, it is beautiful. 
<h3>MOZART, Wolfgang Amadeus</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>STRING QUARTETTE (G Major)<br>
515 Allegro Vivace Assai<br>
516 Minuetto, Allegretto<br>
517 Andante Cantabile<br>
518 Molto Allegro</h4>
We present here four rolls, comprising the complete
Mozart Quartette in G Major. The history
of the string quartette is an interesting
story and this is not the place to record it. Instructive
and entertaining articles on the subject
may be found in "Grove's Dictionary of
Music and Musicians" and any book on the
subject of musical form.
<p>
For our purpose it will suffice to say that the
quartette as we know it was first conceived by
the contemporaries, Haydn and Boccherini.
There was a time when four instruments were
not considered an adequate means for the expression
of musical ideas, and singularly enough,
at this very time, trios were plentiful. Bach
wrote numerous trios, but no quartettes.
Haydn, whose birth antedates Boccherini's by
about eleven years, wrote his first string quartette
in 1755 while paying an extended visit to
a certain von Furnberg. At this time was born
the form which has been closely adhered to by
all the classical writers since.
<p>
This first quartette was a mere child according
to present standards, but one of much promise.
It grew under the careful nurturing of its
father to maturity, and his eighty-three quartettes
speak eloquently of the father's love for
this child of his brain.
<p>
Mozart, with his genius for polyphony, found
here the medium through which he could express
himself to his liking. He studied the
later quartettes of Haydn, and enlarged upon
them, writing twenty-six in all, six of which he
dedicated to Haydn. These six, with three he
composed for the King of Prussia, are immortal.
Nor was Mozart unmindful of the debt he owed
his exemplar, for he said, "It was from Haydn
that I first learned the true way to compose
quartettes." This seems a good place to record
what Haydn said to Mozart's father: "I declare
to you before God as a man of honor, that
your son is the greatest composer that I know,
either personally or by reputation; he has taste,
and beyond that the most consummate knowledge
of the art of composition."
<p>
The various movements of the G Major Quartette
are examples of perfect music. They are 
perfect in melody, harmony and form. Nothing
could be more beautiful. We would suggest
the playing of the four rolls in the order
given. This plan will lead to a better knowledge
of the structure of the quartette, and make
it possible to observe closely the sequence of
ideas, which is extremely interesting. We bespeak
for these rolls the respectful hearing they
merit, and anticipate for them a cordial reception
from music lovers.
<h4>522 Allegro Vivace Assai, from B flat Major Quartette</h4>
This is the first movement of the immortal
B flat major string quartette. It is one of those
rare feats of composition which could no more
be duplicated than could a violin by Stradivari.
It is sharp and clean as a cameo, not one note
could be taken from or added to it except to its
detriment. It is a thing of perfection.
<h4>528 Allegro, Finale to Quartette No. 10</h4>
This is essentially a rollicking rondo, which is
the musical counterpart of the literary form.
known as a rondeau. In the literary form there 
are six or eight lines containing but two rhymes,
the first and last lines being identical.
<p>
The processes of evolution are always interesting.
What we designate as "form" is the result
of such a process. The evolution of form
was probably unconscious, and was, more than
likely, in the case of music, a natural longing
for something analogous to the symmetry in
architecture. The poetry in music is nothing
more nor less than the form in music.
<p>
Examples of unmistakable form are found in
the music of the early part of the sixteenth century,
and in these examples we find the inception
of the rondo, which now consists of a principal
theme of a definite length which recurs at
stated intervals. The connecting links between
the recurrences of the theme are short excursions
into various keys, which furnish an agreeable
contrast and prevent any possibility of
monotony. The rondo reached its highest development
at the hands of Mozart. Beethoven
elaborated somewhat upon his gorgeous models,
but the form is essentially as Mozart left it.
Any further development of the form of the
rondo is an extremely remote possibility. It
is one of those things which has gravitated to its
proper place and there it will stay.
The rondo recorded here is a perfect example
of the form by one of its greatest exponents.
On first hearing, it is extremely pleasing, for it
is superlatively brilliant. For those who care
to dig below the surface there is a mine of pleasure
which is not for those who only listen superficially
or perfunctorily.
<h4>657 Minuetto<br>
658 Allegro Molto from Symphony in G Minor</h4>
We present here two movements from what is
very generally believed to be Mozart's greatest
symphony. It is at least the most popular of
them all.
<p>
Ambros, the greatest of the German critics,
mentions three Mozart symphonies, of which
the G Minor is one, and says of them, "Considered
as pure music, it is hardly worth while
to ask whether the world possesses anything
more perfect." Jahn, Mozart's biographer,
says of the same symphony that it is "A work
of art exhausting its topic."
<p>
It is futile to try to say more in praise of this
masterpiece. The Allegro Molto is the first
movement and the Minuetto the third. The last
movement, No. 669, follows. In the near future
the slow movement also will be arranged. It
will then be possible to play the whole symphony
with the movements in their proper order.
Meanwhile, the present two movements are
complete in themselves and suffer no loss in
beauty by being separated.
<h4>669 Allegro Assai, Finale of G Minor Symphony</h4>
It is futile to attempt anything in the way of
praise for this masterpiece. It has stood the
test of time, and is today as fresh and bright as
the day it was written. In the paragraphs concerning
other movements of this symphony we
have expatiated upon the beauties of the symphony
as a whole, and it would perhaps be as
well to stop right here with the statement that
this movement is an example of perfect music.
<h3>NEVIN, Ethelbert</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue. Volume 1)
<h4>461 Slumber Song</h4>
It is not strange that a man with Nevin's gift
of melody should succumb to the fascinating
qualities of this form of writing known variously
as slumber song, berceuse, lullaby, etc.
It is a seductive form and Nevin's work would
have been incomplete without a representative.
Here we have a thing that is altogether lovely.
One could not wish it different in any particular.
Itis beautiful through and through.
<h4>642 Venezia-Alba, Gondolieri, Canzone Amorosa, Buona Notte</h4>
Under the general title of Venezia, Nevin wrote
the four short pieces bearing the above names.
Two of these, Gondolieri and Canzone Amorosa,
are already in our catalogue as separate
numbers. We have now thought it best to make
a roll containing all four numbers and to discontinue
the two separate rolls.
<p>
The playing of the four numbers in the proper
sequence adds much charm to the suite, and we
are sure that the new roll will meet with the reception
it deserves.
<h3>NEVIN, Gordon Balch 1892-</h3>
Gordon Balch Nevin is one of the most promising of
the younger American composers. He was born at
Easton. Pa., May 19, 1892. His principal teachers 
were J. Warren Andrews and J. Fred Wolle. He has
been active as a church and concert organist for some
years, and has a very extensive repertoire.
<p>
His compositions include a number of organ pieces
and songs, as well as a number of arrangements. In
a literary way he has not been idle, having contributed
many articles to the "Musician," "Etude" and other
journals.
<h4>456 Will O' the Wisp</h4>
This is a diminutive toccata-a toccatina. It
would be difficult to find a more appropriate
name for this composition than the one chosen
by the composer. It is bewitching, scintillating,
dazzling and sparkling-really a charming bit
of music.
<h3>NOBLE, T. Tertius 1867-</h3>
This organist and composer, now well known to Americans,
was born in Bath, England, May 5, 1867. He
came to New York in 1912 to become organist of St.
Thomas' Episcopal Church. He has been very active
both as a player and a composer since his arrival in
America. His compositions include services, offertories,
a cantata, a comic opera, pieces for orchestra,
chamber music, piano pieces and various other works. 
<h4>548 Nachspiel</h4>
This is a fine vigorous piece, well adapted to display
the power and roundness of the "king of
instruments." It is rather modern in conception.
<h3>NOVELLO, Ivor</h3>
<h4>369 Keep the Home Fires Burning</h4>
This song voices a sentiment which should be
shared by all. To many, the silver lining referred
to in the refrain will never show itself,
but the admonition to "turn the dark cloud inside
out" is worthy of application in all cases.
<h3>PADEREWSKI, Ignaz Jan 1860-</h3>
Whether this noble son of Poland is considered from a
political or musical aspect, the result is unqualified
admiration.
<p>
It is the musical side of this remarkable man with
which we have here to do. He was born in Podolia,
Poland, November 6, 1860. At the age of sixteen he 
went on his first concert tour, and in 1879 became a
teacher of piano at the Warsaw Conservatorium. He
then went to Berlin and studied with Urban and
Wuerst, and finally to Leschetitzky. From the time
of his debuts in Vienna and Paris his career has been
an unbroken triumph. He came to America in 1891,
and met with a most spontaneous reception. He is
very generally considered the world's greatest pianist.
<p>
Reputation, of course, is a thing that is made or
acquired. Character is inherent-subject naturally to
certain modifications. Few personages of reputation
have had thrust upon them the necessity of revealing
their characters to the extent required of Paderewski,
and fortunate indeed is the man who is of such sterling
stuff as to run the gauntlet unscathed. He is unique
among men; first, a great musician, without a superior
as a performer on his chosen instrument. Then
his opportunity came and he became at once a great
statesman. It is a pleasure to meditate upon such a man.
<h4>422 Melodie, Op. 8, No. 3</h4>
This exquisite bit of writing is Number 8 in a
set of piano pieces comprising Op. 8. It is a
plaintive melody of enchanting beauty and its
sustained songlike qualities make it especially
adaptable to the organ. 
<h3>PARKER, Horatio William 1888-</h3>
One of the greatest of American composers is H. W.
Parker. He was born at Auburndale, Massachusetts,
September 15, 1863. He studied in Bodon with
Emery, Orth and Chadwick, also in Munich with
Rheinberger and Abel. Returning to America he
became organist and professor of music at the Cathedral
School at Garden City, Long Island. He was
succesnvely organist and choirmader at St. Andrew's,
New York, and Holy Trinity, Boston.
<p>
In 1894, his oratorio "Hora Novissima" was performed,
and met with a most flattering reception.
In the same year he was called to the chair of music
at Yale Univernty. In 1911, his opera "Mona" won
the ten-thousand-dollar prize offered by the Metropolitan
Opera House. In 1913 his opera "Fairyland"
won a similar prize offered by the National
Federation of Women's Clubs.
<p>
His compositions include most of the accepted forms,
with choral works in the majority.
<h4>682 Canzonetta, Op. 36, No. 1</h4>
Canzonetta is the diminutive of canzone, and
therefore means a little song or tune, which is
just what this is. It is a charming little tune
of the kind that only a big man can write. The
stamp of the master is all over it. Then, too, it
was written for the organ, which means that the
roll gives it in inimitable fashion. 
<h3>PONCHIELLI, Amilcare 1834-1886</h3>
This sterlmg operatic composer was born at Paderno
Fasolaro, Cremona, September 1, 1834. In 1843 he
entered the Conservatorio at Milan, and in one capacity
or another remained there until 1854. His first
opera was a success, as was the case with all those that
followed. His "chef d'oeuvre" is "Gioconda," which has
never waned in popularity since its premier production
in Italy in 1876. His demise on January 16, 1886, at
Milan, robbed Italy of the man believed in that country
to have been Verdi's successor.
<h4>420 Dance ofthe Hours-Balletfrom La Gioconda</h4>
The various subtitles to this exquisite ballet
indicate the intent of the composer, and add to
the interest of the hearer.
<p>
"The Hours of Dawn" begin in a mysterious
pianissimo, suggesting the awakening and first
song of the birds. Presently the "Hours of
Day" enter on a crescendo, and after a rather
sustained passage begins the dance of the
"Hours of Day." This is one of the most indescribably
graceful dances ever penned. Then,
no less gracefully, enter the "Hours of Evening,"
with the birds' bedtime song. Lastly
enter the "Hours of Night," with a somewhat
forboding tune which forms a striking contrast
to the preceding themes. A passage in 3-4
time, which is as much recitative as anything
else, serves to whet the desire for another tune
of a brighter hue, which fairly dazzles one with
its bubbling impetuosity, bringing to a close a
most delightful example of ballet music.
<h3>RACHMANINOFF, Sergei Vassilievich</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>428 Serenade</h4>
This great Russian is one of the most versatile
of contemporaneous composers. He can soar to
the heights of a classic, as, for instance, in the
C sharp minor prelude, or remain among mortals
and pen an enrapturing serenade which
would do credit to the most ardent Spanish
lover, as he has done in the present number.
<p>
This is one of the most captivating and seductive
bits of writing to be found. It is strikingly
Spanish-or at least Latin in flavor-and is
delightful in the extreme. 
<h3>RAFF, Joseph Joachim</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>374 March, "Parting," Lenore Symphony (Fifth)</h4>
The Fifth Symphony as a whole bears the title
of "Lenore," and is based on a ballad bearing
the same title, written by Gottfried August
Burger, and translated into English by Sir
Walter Scott.
<p>
Like all "programme" music, this symphony
may convey the intended meaning to one person,
and to another it may have an entirely different
significance. This is not the place for a disquisition
on merits of the music from a programme
point of view, even though space permitted.
<p>
For our purposes it will suffice to state that this
march, for thematic beauty and general fine
workmanship, is scarcely surpassed. It is a
great favorite and extremely effective as given
by the roll.
<h3>RAMEAU, Jean Philippe</h3>
Volumes have been written about this distinguished
French composer, who was born at Dijon, October 23,
1683. His father was a musician and organist of the
Dijon Cathedral. Pater, with the best intentions, desired
to make of his eldest son, Jean, a magistrate.
Parental desire was as strong then as now, and just as
futile. One thing is certain, a magistrate cannot be
made of a boy predestined to be a musician, nor can
anything else be made of him. Doctors and clergymen
are often made of material much better suited to some
other purpose, and in many instances live to ripe old
age without discovering the fact. Not so with the
musician! All the talk we hear about the man who
would have been a great musician, if he had had the
opportunity, is twaddle. If he had had in him the stuff
of which great musicians are made, he would have made
the opportunity. An effort was made to make a lawyer
of Handel; an author of Schumann; a lawyer of
Tschaikowsky; a diplomat of Thalberg; a priest of
Haydn; a butcher of Dvorak; a blacksmith of Rossini,
and so on. Many more might be added, but these
suffice to establish the point.
<p>
Rameau was a very normal boy - except for his great
musical talent. He possessed all the boyish frailties,
including obstinacy, to a marked degree. Then, too, at
seventeen he fell in love with a widow much his senior,
but from all these things he recovered, and became one
of the greatest composers and theorists of his time.
Seven works on theory, thirteen operas and many miscellaneous
works are left as a result of his genius and
industry, and music made much progress as a result
of his discoveries and work.
<h4>419 Rigaudon.</h4>
The English spelling is Rigadoon, and its popularity
in England has caused some writers to
believe it to be of English origin. Its popularity
in France, however, antedates its English favor 
by many years, and Rousseau states that it derived
its name from its inventor, Rigaud. It is
characterized by a peculiar jumping step, and is
in 2-4 or 4-4 time. The number of bars is unequal,
and the music begins in the latter half of
the measure.
<p>
Its origin is, of course, a matter of historical
interest, but as a quaint old bit of composition,
the present roll holds a more immediate interest.
It is like a chapter from a musty old book.
<h3>READ, Edward M.</h3>
<h4>635 Offertoire in A flat</h4>
This is a composition of stereotyped form. It
begins with a martial theme on full organ, after
which a quieter theme on the wood winds occurs,
corresponding somewhat to the trio in the regular
march form.
<p>
This is followed by a hornlike solo on the diapason;
a recurrence of the first theme; an oboe
solo, etc., finishing with the first theme extended
into massive chords on the full organ.
The variety of thematic material, together with
the contrast in power and tone color, makes a
delightful number of this, and one which will
receive the approbation of all organ owners. 
<h3>REEVES, D. W.</h3>
The leader of the famous American Band of Providence
has long been known as a writer of marches and
other music of the lighter forms, and a march from his
pen is always popular.
<h4>372 Second Connecticut March</h4>
This is one of the marches popular with military
bands. It is in 6-8 time and possesses the necessary
martial quality, and is, as well, a good
number for dancing purposes.
<h3>REIFF, Stanley T. 1881-</h3>
A number of very well-received organ numbers have
been written by this composer, who was born in Philadelphia
in 1881. His published works also include
songs and choral works. He studied with Dr. Frank
H. Shepherd and Dr. Hugh A. Clarke, and received
the degree of Bachelor of Music at the University of
Pennsylvania. He is organist of the First Methodilt
Episcopal Ckurch, West Chester, Pa., and a member
of the American Guild of Organists and the Organ
Players' Club.
<h4>501 Bonne Nuit</h4>
"Good Night" is a very happy title for this little
number. It is serene and peaceful, and leaves
one in a delightful meditative mood. Its only
weak point is its brevity. 
<h4>512 Scherzo</h4>
This is a scherzo which might have been just as
well called a gavotte. It is not at all like the
generally accepted scherzo form, but scherzo
means literally a jest. For our purposes the
lack of orthodox form is no detriment. It is a
jolly good tune, well written, and charming
throughout.
<h4>514 Bon Jour</h4>
This is a sprightly little composition which
holds attention from beginning to end. Its
vivacity is largely responsible for its charm.
The variety of registration given it by the roll
is a matter of interest and serves to make more
enjoyable an already delectable bit of music.
<h3>RENAUD, Albert 1855-</h3>
This French composer was born in Paris in 1855. He
studied with Franck and Delibes. He was organist for
some time of St. Francis Xavier in Paris, then gave
up playing to devote his entire time to composition.
His works include three operas, several ballets, incidental
music to "Don Quixote," a mass, and numerous
pieces for piano, organ and orchestra. 
<h4>670 Grand Choeur</h4>
This is a grand finale or postlude of a type that
most French organists have written. It is a
fine thing to show off the power of the organ.
The harmonies are modern, but not extremely
so. It is an altogether charming example of the
well-known form.
<h3>RHEINBERGER, Joseph Gabriel 1837-1901</h3>
Rhemberger was born March 17, 1839, at Vaduz,
Liechtenstein. His father was unmusical but quickly
recognized the unusual talent of his son and placed
him under the instruction of Sebastian Pohly, a superannuated
school master, who taught him theory, pianoforte
and organ. So precocious was this youth, that
at the age of seven he was appointed organist of the
parish church at Vaduz, and during the following year
a three-part mass of his composition was publicly
performed.
<p>
Prodigies often fail to live up to expectations, but
Rheinberger was one great exception. He became one
of the greatest authorities on composition of his time.
He wrote in all forms with the hand of a master. He
was prolific, too--his opus numbers reaching the startling
total of one hundred ninety-seven, in addition to
about a dozen works bearing no opus number. He was
a noble musician--a credit to his profession.
<h4>589 Vision, Op., 156, No.5</h4>
This is one of a set of twelve short pieces written 

for the organ-perhaps the best-known one of 

the set. It is not startling in any sense, but reveals
the sterling musicianship of the composer. 

It is just good, strong, sturdy, sensible music, 

lacking nothing that would add to its beauty and 

containing not a non-essential note.
<h3>RICE, Gitz</h3>
Gitz Rice was a lieutenant in the first Canadian contingent.
He had a local reputation as a musician and 

composer before the war, but was not well known in 

this country until after the United States cast her lot 

with the Allies and it became necessary to raise money 

by the sale of Liberty Bonds. He was sent here to help 

in that laudable purpose, and appeared on the stage 

of many theatres of the country in a successful appeal 

to the patriotism and generosity of the American 

people. He wrote a number of songs, the most popular
of which--and perhaps the best--is "Dear Old 
Pal of Mine." 

<h4>434 Dear Old Pal of Mine</h4>
This song has become immensely popular for 

two reasons: First, the sentiment is of a kind 

which finds a ready response in the hearts of 

thousands in these times; second, the melody
is singable and possesses much genuine merit.
With these two qualities it is not strange that
the song has been so widely sung and well
received by the public.
<h3>RIMSKY-KORSAKOW, Nikolas Andreievitch 1844-1908</h3>
Nikolas Andreievitch Rimsky-Korsakow was born at
Tikhvin, Novgorod, Russia, May 21, 1844, and died
at Petrograd, June 21, 1908. He studied the 'cello
and piano during his naval course. He was a professor
in the Conservatory at Petrograd for about thirty
seven years.
<p>
His Compositions include several operas, many orchestral
works, including three symphonies, overtures,
symphonic poems, chamber music, piano pieces, songs
and choruses. He is considered one of the greatest
masters of orchestration.
<h4>RIMSKY-KORSAKOW-KREISLER<br>
653 Hindoo Chant from the Opera "Sadko"</h4>
This splendid little piece, transcribed by Mr.
Kreisler and made popular by him, breathes
exoticism from every phrase. Its meditative
mood is most charming and restful.
<p>
The opera "Sadko," from which this gem is
taken, is little known outside of Russia, the reason
being, perhaps, the peculiarly national
character of the libretto.
<h3>ROGER-DUCASSE, Jean Jules Amable 1875-</h3>
This Ultramodern French composer was born in Bordeaux,
April 18, 1875. He was a pupil of Faure, and
in 1902 won, the second Prix de Rome at the Paris
Consertvatoire. Since he first attracted attention with
his "Variations plaisantes sur un theme grave,' his
name has figured prominently in Paris concerts. His
works include all forms, including suites, symphonies
and symphonic poems for orchestra.
<h4>644 Pastorale</h4>
This is a remarkable composition of the modern
French schooI. It sounds much like Debussy,
but is rather more definite in form than most of
the Debussy efforts. The theme, as first announced,
is a pastorale of the purest type. The
development is most wonderful. The composer
seems to have completely exhausted the possibilities
of his theme, and has undoubtedly produced
a masterpiece. The technical requirements
are such that it can only be attempted by
organists who are absolute masters of organ
technique in all its branches. The present roll
is wonderful in every sense. 
<h3>ROGERS, James Hotchkiss 1857-</h3>
This well-known composer was born in Fair Haven,
Conn., February 7, 1857. He was educated at the
Lake Foreat Academy, Lake Forest, Ill. After studies
with Clarence Eddy and J. M. Towne in Chicago, he
went to Berlin and placed himself under Haupt and
Loeschhorn, and later under Guilmant and Widor in
Paris. He has been in Cleveland, Ohio, for many
years, where he has been, actively engaged as a teacher
and music critic. He is a prolific composer in all the
smaller forms, such as songs, anthems, organ and
piano pieces. His compositions also include two
cantatas.
<p>
Few American composers are better known than the
subject of this paragraph. His works are all good
and enjoy a wide popularity.
<h4>446 Intermezzo</h4>
This number is one from a suite for organ, and
is as sprightly a thing as one would want to hear.
It is not of a serious nature, but, as the title
would indicate, is intended to fill in between
matters of greater import-to serve as a contrast
to what has gone before and whet the appetite
for what is to come. It serves its purpose
admirably, and is a delightful little number. 
<h3>ROSSINI, Gioacruno Antonio</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>556 Overture Tancrede</h4>
The opera of Tancrede marks the first step in 

the revolution which Rossini was destined to 

effect in Italian opera. The overture here given 

is in the true Italian style and is not particularly 

revolutionary. It bears, however, unmistakable 

evidences of the genius which finally found and 

crystallized itself in "Tell." This overture will 

always be popular as a concert number, and 
 justly so. 

<h4>599 Overture-Italian in Algiers</h4>
The type of Italian overture of the time of Rossini
is well exemplified in this roll. Rossini 

wrote many operas, all of which, with the exception
of "William Tell," had overtures of the 

then prevailing style. The present overture is 

one of the best of its kind and is a favorite. As 

a four-hand piano arrangement, it is particularly
well known. In the organ arrangement, 

the orchestral score has been rigidly adhered to, 

the result being highly satisfactory. 

<h3>ROUGET DE L'ISLE, Claude Joseph 1760-1836</h3>
The subject of this paragraph was born at Montaigu,
Lons-le-Saulnier, on May 10, 1760. He was educated
at the School of Royal Engineers at Mezieres. He
rose from the rank of aspirant-lieutenant to firat
lieutenant, and was atationed at Strassburg, where his
versatility as a poet, singer and violin player brought
him much popularity.
<p>
He wrote a number of songs and poems which enjoyed
more or less popular favor, but his fame rests on the
fact that he was the author and composer of the "Marseillaise."
<p>
Rouget de l'Isle was the son of Royalist parents and,
belonging to the constitutional party, he refused to
take the oath to the constitution abolishing the crown.
He was stripped of his military rank, denounced and
imprisoned. He celebrated his escape after the fall
of Robespierre in a "Hymne dithyrambique." Reentering
the army, he made the campaign of La Vendee
under General Hoche, was wounded, and returned to
private life at Montaigu, remaining there in poverty
and solitude until the second Restoration. The sale
of the little family property by his brother drove him
to Paris, and there, but for a small pension granted
by Louis XVIII and continued by Louis Philippe, he
would have starved. His frienda, Beranger, David
d'Angers and eapecially M. and Mme. Voiart-in
whose house at Choisy-le-Roi he died-did much to
make bearable his miserable existence. He died June 27, 1836.
<h4>375 La Marseillaise</h4>
Both the words and music of this stirring
anthem were written by Claude Joseph Rouget 
de l'Isle, who, as a captain of engineers, was
quartered at Strassburg when the volunteers of
the Bas Rhin received orders to join Luckner's
army. The mayor of Strassburg, one Dietrich,
in discussing the war, regretted that the soldiers
had no patriotic song to sing as they marched
out. Rouget de l'Isle hurried to his lodgings
and, filled with enthusiasm, wrote the words and
music af this truly martial song, which in these
days has a greater significance than ever.
<p>
The song as now known is essentially as it was
written. The harmonies have been enriched,
but the melody, except for a very few notes,
remains the same.
<h3>RUBINSTEIN, Anton Gregor</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>545 Serenade</h4>
Rubinstein's gift of melody is well exemplified
in this number, which might as appropriately be
called a barcarole. He announces the theme
in the simplest possible fashion, and then begins
a series of elaborations in the accompaniment to
a new theme which is highly ingenious and delightful.
<p>
The organ arrangement presents a variety of
tone color which rivals an orchestra. 
<h3>SAINT -SAENS, Charles Camille</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>398 The Deluge-Prelude</h4>
This is the Prelude or Overture to a dramatic
oratorio based on the fall of man, the wrath of
God, the covenant with Noah, the building of
the Ark, and the Deluge.
<p>
The first theme is one of great breadth, followed
by a fugal treatment of a rather melancholy
theme which dies away with the subsiding
waters. Then is heard the benediction, which is
a violin solo of incomparable beauty.
<h4>450 Danse Macabre</h4>
Here is a remarkable example of programme
music which was inspired by a poem by Henri
Cazalis. We give a free translation of the poem,
and are sure much interest will be aroused by a
comparative study of the translation (or original)
and the music.
<p>
Zig, zig, zig, Death striking with his heel on a tombstone in cadence,<br>
Death at midnight plays a dance tune, zig, zig, zag, on his violin.<br>
The winter wind blows, the night is dark, groans are heard in the lindens;<br>
White skeletons flit across the shadows, running and bounding under their shrouds.<br>
Zig, zig, zig, they bestir themselves, you can hear the rattle of the dancers' bones,<br>
But pst! suddenly they cease their whirl; they scuffle and flee, for the cock has crowed.
<p>
The clock strikes twelve to the accompaniment
of the strings, and Death begins to tune his
fiddle (which, by the way, he never gets in tune
-always tuning the E string to E flat). Then
the skeletons appear. Their numbers increase
with the progress of the dance, Death stopping
now and then to tune his fiddle. The dance assumes
the proportions of an orgy-wild, unrestrained,
tempestuous, riotous, grotesque.
<p>
Suddenly the dance stops, day dawns, and the
cock crows. Then is heard the quiet scuffling of
the skeletons to get back to their graves.
Few descriptive efforts, if any, compare with
this one. It was written in 1874 and has never
wavered in popularity since its first hearing. It
is a truly remarkable piece of writing and
thoroughly enjoyable as given by the roll.
<h4>708 Berceuse</h4>
There is an adage to the effect that true greatness
lies in the ability to do little things beautifully
and easily. Unlike many adages, it is 
true. Beethoven was greater in his songs and
short instrumental pieces than in his symphonies.
If you don't believe it take one of his
symphonies, play it on the piano, thereby
robbing it of all the color of the orchestra-making
of it, as it were, a symphony in monotone,
and see if it compares favorably with some of
the smallest things written for the piano.
Saint-Saens was a big man who has proved his
greatness many times in the writing of little
things that were charming in their simplicity.
This Berceuse is one of them.
<h3>SALOME, Theodore Cesar</h3>
(For Biograpltictil Sketch see Catalogue. Volume 1)
<h4>437 Offertoire in D flat</h4>
This noted Parisian organist has written many
things in the smaller forms, but he has rarely
reached heights of greater beauty in melody
than in this Offertoire. After a measure or two
of the accompaniment alone, which serves to
thoroughly establish the rhythm in one's mind, a
melody of superlative beauty begins. A middle
part which is in broad contrast serves to maintain
interest and whet the musical appetite for
a repetition of the first theme, which finally
appears and sings itself to a graceful and fitting close.
<h4>577 Grand Chorus</h4>
This is a vigorous composition for the organ by
a noted French organist. It is of the type used
generally as a postlude in church services, and
a particularly good example. The French composers
of the old school, Guilmant, Widor,
Wely, Salome, etc., were especially fond of this
form, and their efforts in this direction resulted
in some wonderful music. They invariably had
something to say and said it well.
<h3>SALVINO, Domenica</h3>
<h4>743 Twilight Hour</h4>
This is a splendid melody, delightfully harmonized.
It is simple, plaintive and seductive - really
a delectable thing, and appropriately
named. While written for orchestra, it fits the
organ as though made for it. 
<h3>SCHMINKE, Oscar E. 1881-</h3>
Schmmke was born in New York City, December 12,
1881. He early showed musical talent, but a slight
deafness dissuaded him from adopting music as a profession.
He studied dentistry at the New York College
of Dentistry and graduated m 1903. Shortly
after this his hearing improved and he studied theory
and harmony with Spielter and Spicker. In 1909 he
abandoned dentistry and studied piano and organ with
Dethier. His compositions have met with success
through their sheer merit.
<h4>626 Marche Russe</h4>
This is a remarkable march, composed of Russian
tunes. It is dedicated to T. Tertius Noble
of St. Thomas' Church, New York. A more
stately and inspiring march would be difficult
to imagine. It is dignified and masterful in
treatment-a most charming and thrilling composition.
<h4>627 Festal Postlude</h4>
There is a story to the effect that when Mendelssohn
played the organ the people refused to
leave the church as long as he played. A "postlude"
is designed to play the people out of
church. This is a most attractive piece and the
Estey Organist may be depended upon to play
it as it should be played. 
<h3>SCHONBERGER, John</h3>
<h4>561 Whispering</h4>
<h3>SCHUBERT, Franz Peter</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>652 Ave Maria</h4>
For our arrangement of this delightful composition
we have chosen the famous Wilhelmj
transcription for the violin, rather than the
original song, and the result more than justified
our judgment.
<p>
As we have it on the roll, it is one of the most
charming violin solos ever written. The use of
the harp for accompanimental purposes is effective
in the extreme. It is difficult to imagine
anything more beautiful than this roll.
<h4>725 Overture-Rosamunde, Op. 26</h4>
The world is indebted to Sir George Grove and
Sir Arthur Sullivan for this beautiful music.
After its second performance, in 1828, it was
shelved and forgotten. 
<p>
In 1867, Grove and Sullivan set out for Vienna
to recover what remained of Schubert's unpublished
manuscripts. They found a number of
things and were about to depart for Prague
when they made a final call on Dr. Schneider to
take leave and repeat thanks for his hospitality.
Guided, as Grove believed, by a special instinct,
he turned the conversation to the Rosamunde
music. The doctor believed he had at one time
possessed a copy or sketch of it. Grove asked
permission to go to the cupboard and look for
himself. The doctor did not object. After a
long search, during which time Sullivan kept
the doctor engaged in conversation, Grove found
in the farthest corner a bundle of music books
two feet high, black with the undisturbed dust
of a half century. Here was the blessed object
of their search. By the doctor's permission, it
was, hastily copied and given to the world.
<h4>735 Andante con Moto</h4>
We quote the following from "Symphonies and
Their Meaning" by Philip H. Goepp: 
<p>

"At last Schubert's long restrained melody has 

a vent. As the Allegro was all vague motion, 
this is pure, continuous melody--one golden
fabric. To 'explain' this lyric gem seems impertinent
for two opposite reasons, its simplicity
and its mystery. It is the typical paradox of
the master himself. There is, throughout, the
puzzling blending of lightest humor with deep
meaning. At the outset it seems clearly a
restrained dance. Then to the same sprightly
step comes the song of principal melody by
oboe. If we cared to analyze more technically,
we could see how the mixture of minor mood
with sprightly gait helps the mystery. But,
usually, in groping for ingredients, in tearing
apart the rose-petals, the main fragrance is lost.
But in the next boisterous blast of the whole
band and in the striding of strings in mock
heroic dignity, there is no doubt the childlike,
playful humor, pure fun, whence, through warning
signs to hold our faces, we return to the
serious beauty of the first melody. Still, it is
now not the first song in doubling duet; but
there is the daintiest interplay between the
phrases of gentlest mockery. How wonderful is
the versatile power of music for mirroring humor!
Could any words, spoken or written, possibly
approach remotely its delicate changes?" 
<h3>SCHUMANN, Robert Alexander.</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>383 Allegro Animato-Finale: Symphony No.1 in B flat</h4>
After a somewhat sombre introduction of six
measures, this number breaks into an infectious
dance tune. Indeed, the whole movement teems
with the gaiety of the ballroom.
The second theme is one of extreme quaintness,
and is interrupted in most original and humorous
fashion by a ponderous theme in unison,
which, more than likely after it has passed, one
remembers to be the one which served as an
introduction. This introductory theme is extensively
developed in the middle part, after
which the joyous themes recur. Another short
development section serves for a close.
<h4>384 Scherzo, Symphony No. 1 in B flat</h4>
This movement is one of marked exuberance
and charm. A novel effect is to be heard in the
first trio,-when the time changes from 3-4 to
2-4,-which displays a degree of naivete seldom
equaled. The second trio is more orthodox in
character, and is in 3-4 time. The coda, which
is a strain from the second theme, completes a
movement bewitching in its poetic beauty . 
<h4>399 Arabesque</h4>
The term arabesque was originally an architectural
one, and was applied to ornamentation
in Arabic style, as the term would indicate.
Musically it was first used by Schumann as a
title for one of his most charming piano pieces.
Other composers have used the name for pieces
of indefinite form, and it seems likely to take
its place among other names of ambiguous
significance.
<p>
The appellation need not worry us, however;
the music is lovely, and that is all that concerns us.
<p>
Two pieces, from the Album for the Young<br>
<h4>406 No. 17, Roaming in the Morning; No. 29, The Strange Man</h4>
Three pieces, from the Album for the Young<br>
<h4>407 No. 30-No. 28, In Memoriam; No. 13, A Maying We Will Go</h4>
<h4>408 No. 12, "Knight Rupert"</h4>
Schumann wrote a series of short pieces for the
piano which he called the "Album for the 
Young." The character of these pieces would
seem to indicate that the standard of musical
appreciation in the young of Schumann's day
must have been very high. Most of the numbers
in this collection are superlatively beautiful,
and merit the attention of the most mature musical
mind. They will bear the closest scrutiny,
and are indeed gems of purest water.
<p>
We offer six of the most charming of these
jewels of sound, arranged on three rolls.
<p>
It is interesting to note that the numbers which
have titles were named invariably after they
were composed. Schumann too well knew of
the futility of trying to convey a defurite impression
by means of sound. He therefore
wisely wrote what was in his mind, and then
gave it what seemed to him to be an appropriate name.
<p>
We may say that the name given roll No. 408
is that of a legendary German character, who
dresses in a rough Santa-Claus suit, and goes
around before Christmas catechising the children
concerning their behavior during the past year.
<p>
This music is too lovely to be missed, and these
three rolls should have their full share of appreciation.
<h4>552 Andante un poco maestoso, First Movement from Symphony in B flat</h4>
Of the four symphonies written by Schumann,
this First holds, perhaps, the greatest amount
of public favor. The reason is probably found
in the fact that it is a truly inspired work. It
was his second attempt at orchestral writing, so
it must be assumed that his technique along this
line was limited, and that his hand was guided by
a higher p'ower than mere knowledge.
<p>
Schumann wrote it, as he wrote in a letter to
Taubert, when the first breath of spring was in
the air, and intended calling it the "Spring
Symphony." This movement was to be called
"Spring's Awakening." These facts are interesting
and add a charm to the hearing of the roll,
which performs this wonderful music in a most
satisfactory manner.
<h4>593 Canon in B Minor, Op. 56</h4>
Schumann wrote six canons for the pedal piano,
which form his Op. 56. The present one in B
minor is a canon in the octave and a most interesting
one. The organ brings out the imitating
part with great clarity and charm. Indeed, it 
is extremely difficult to do it on the piano half
so well. Because of its adaptability to the organ
it is a favorite with organ players, and its innate
beauty assures it a cordial reception from the public.
<h4>656 Sostenuto Assai from Quartette, Op.47</h4>
Among the very finest examples of chamber
music are the quintettes for piano and strings,
Op. 44, and the quartette for piano and strings,
Op. 47. Nothing finer than these exists. We
have made an organ adaptation of the first
movement of the quartette which has been a
delight to all who have heard it.
<p>
There is no other single instrument which could
do anything approaching justice to such a composition.
But, after all, an organ is not a single
instrument. It is a quartette, quintette, orchestra,
or any other composite instrument.
<h3>SCOTT, Cyril Meir 1879-</h3>
One of the most imteresting of contemporary composers
is Cyril Scott, who was born at Oxton, Cheshire,
England, September 27, 1879. After studying
piano wntil he was seventeen, he went to Frankfort and
studied composition under Professor Iwan Knorr. He
soon rebelled at the restraint of rules of composition
and cast his lot with the ultramoderns, with Debussy
as his model. He has been called Debussy's English
double. In spite of his impressionistic writings he
has an enormous following, and not without good
reason, for his works are full of charm and grow better
the oftener they are heard.
<p>
Scott is also a theosophist and a lecturer on occult
philosophy. He thoroughly believes in the relation
between colors and tones. He has written extensively
on esthetics and the occult aspects of music. His
works up to Opus 59 include all the larger forms as
well as songs, piano pieces, etc.
<h4>613 Vesperale, Op. 40, No.2</h4>
This is a very good example of Scott's style. It
is modern in the extreme but is reasonable. The
composer has striven for certain effects with
most happy and satisfactory results. Its sustained
qualities make it particularly adaptable
to the organ.
<h4>717 Lotus Land, Op. 47, No.1</h4>
The success of Scott's "Vesperale," which we
recorded as No. 613, caused us to look around
for something else by this modern English composer
which would lend itself successfully to an
organ adaptation. 
<p>
We have found it in "Lotus Land."
We are sure that our clients will be more than
pleased with this arrangement, as it is more
beautiful than on the piano. It is Scott in one
of his most interesting moods-more need not
be said about it.
<h3>SHELLEY, Harry Rowe 1858-</h3>
Few American composers are better known than
Harry Rowe Shelley, who was born in Connecticut,
June 8,1858. He studied music with Gustave Stoeckel
at Yale University, and with Dudley Buck, Dvorak
and Vogrich in New York. At the age of fourteen he
was organist of Centre Church, New Haven. Conn.,
later going to New York City to become organist in a
Brooklyn Church, where he remained wntil 1899, since
which time he has been organist of the Fifth Avenue
Baptist Church, New York City.
<p>
His compositions are numerous and in many forms.
They include songs, anthems, two sacred cantatas,
much organ music, a lyric music drama and a symphony.
<h4>459 Lullaby</h4>
A man has just as much right to compose a
lullaby as has a woman to change her mind.
In the exercise of the God-given prerogatives
referred to, the woman, of course, polls the
larger vote, for the obvious reason that there
are more women who can change their minds
than men who can write a lullaby.
<p>
Shelley, like most other composers, has felt the
charm of this fascinating form and has given
in this number a dainty and enchanting melody,
clothed with harmonies that are as appropriate
as could be.
<h3>SILVERS, Louis</h3>
<h4>703 April Showers, from "Bombo"</h4>
This is one of the hits from Al Jolson's new
show, "Bombo." Perhaps that is all that need
be said with regard to its tunefulness. We have
arranged it as a dance number and it is irresistible.
<h3>SMART, Henry Thomas 1813-1879</h3>
Henry Smart, as he was generally known, was born in
London, October 26, 1813. He started out to study
law, but nature had endowed him with musical talents
which would not be denied, and he soon gave up the
study of law and devoted himself whoUy to music. He
received instruction from W. H. Kearns, but was to a
great extent self-taught. His career as an organist
began at the parish church of Blackburn, Lancashire,
and continued for many years, in fact until his ill
health required him to give up playing. Soon after 
1864 he became blind, and his campositiona after that
date were recorded by the tedious and disheartening
process of dictation. In addition to much argan music
he wrote three cantatas, a successful opera, numerous
choruses and anthems and many part-songs. His work
is all of sterling quality. and his part-songs alone
assure his name of recognition in the future, for they
are lovely indeed. He died July 6, 1879, just after
the English government had voted him a pension of
one hundred pounds a year in acknowledgment of his
services in the cause of music.
<h4>483 Andante Grazioso</h4>
This is a fine andante. It is good, sturdy, real
music. There is no striving for effect. It is
simply a case of having something worth saying,
and the ability to say it well. Play it over
and over again,-it improves upon acquaintance.
<h3>SMETANA, Friedrich</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>727 The Moldau, Symphonic Poem</h4>
The following preface is printed with the score
of "The Moldau":
<p>
"Two springs gush forth in the shade of the 
Bohemian Forest, the one warm and spouting,
the other cold and tranquil. Their waves, gaily
rushing onward over their rocky beds, unite and
glisten in the rays of the morning sun. The
forest brook, fast hurrying on, becomes the river
Vltava (Moldau), which, flowing ever through
Bohemia's valleys, grows to be a mighty stream;
it flows through thick woods in which the joyous
noise of the hunt and the notes of the hunter's
horn are heard ever nearer and nearer; it flows
through the grass grown pastures and lowlands,
where a wedding feast is celebrated with song
and dancing. At night the wood and water
nymphs revel in its shining waves, in which
many fortresses and castles are reflected as
witnesses of the past glory of knighthood and
vanished warlike fame of bygone ages. At the
St. John Rapids the stream rushes on, winding
in and out through the cataracts, and hews out a
path for itself with its foaming waves through
the rocky chasm into the broad river in which
it flows on in majestic repose toward Prague,
welcomed by the time-honored Vysehrad, whereupon
it vanishes in the far distance from the
poet's gaze."
<p>
This wonderful composition was written after
Smetana had entirely lost his hearing. It bears
the pitiful inscription "In complete deafness." 
<h3>SNYDER, Ted</h3>
<h4>711 The Sheik of Araby (Fox Trot)</h4>
Wherever you go you hear "The Sheik." It is
impossible to escape it. It has that elusive
something which appeals to the popular fancy.
Rhythm is perhaps the greatest factor in the
popular success of things such as this, but it is
not the only factor. What the others are we
don't know, but "The Sheik" has them.
<h3>SOWERBY, Leo 1895-</h3>
An American composer, born at Grand Rapids, Michigan,
May 1, 1895. He was educated in America and
teaches theory at the American Conservatory, Chicago.
He is known as a composer of rather radical
tendencies, although he denies that he belongs to
the ultramodern school. His compositions include
numerous sonatas for various instruments, two suites
for piano and violin, organ works, and a rhapsody on
British folk tunes.
<h4>612 The Irish Washerwoman</h4>
A few years ago the New York Symphony
Orchestra, under Walter Damrosch, first played
some Irish tunes which had been arranged by
Percy Grainger, the famous pianist. They instantly
made their way into the hearts of the
people, and one of them, "Molly on the Shore," 
is a genuine favorite and growing in popularity
every minute. It has become somewhat of a
hobby with Grainger to explore and exploit the
music of the past rather than to write original
things. His plan has much to commend it, for
there is an endless supply of old music of the
greatest beauty which would never be heard by
the average person except for the efforts of
Grainger and those following a similar plan.
Mr. Grainger disclaims the credit of being a
pioneer in this respect and gives Grieg the credit.
In any event, the plan is a good one and we hope
that other composers will follow suit. Since
Grainger's first efforts we have had an arrangement
of "Dixie" by Zucca, one of "Turkey in the
Straw" by Guion, and now "The Irish Washerwoman"
by Sowerby.
<p>
"Dixie" is a humorous arrangement in which the
theme is used only as a groundwork for original
treatment. In "The Turkey in the Straw"
Guion has endeavored with great success to give
us the effect produced by the cowboy fiddlers
of Texas. Sowerby's plan with "The Irish
Washerwoman" is identical with Guion's. He
has given us a backwoods rendition of this traditional
tune. It starts off in orthodox fashion.
Before long one of the fiddlers has to tune up,
which he does without regard to the discordant 
sounds he produces. The tune never stops, however,
and here and there an ornament of questionable
beauty is inserted. On and on it goes
until a state of frenzy is reached, every fiddler
doing impossible things and producing the most
atrocious discords. The only thing that remains
as it should be is the rhythm. The effect on the
musicians and dancers is very similar to the religious
fervor witnessed at times at the oldfashioned
camp meetings. We have seen just
such conditions as Sowerby so cleverly depicts.
It is a marvelously clever arrangement. We
would not call it fine music, but it is true to type
and is educational.
<h3>SPENCER, Norman, and McKIERNAN, Joe</h3>
<h4>562 Cuban Moon</h4>
<h3>SPOHR, Louis 1784-1859</h3>
One of the greatest violinists of all time was Louis
Spohr, who was born at Brunswick, April 5, 1784, and
died at Cassel, November 22, 1859. His father was a
physician and an amateur flute player; his mother
a pianist and singer.
<p>
Very early in his life, he began singing duets with his
mother, and at the age of five began the study of the
violin. At fourteen he played before the court a
concerto of his own composition. Spohr's chief
teacher was Franz Eck, who was an excellent violinist
but an indifferent musician. The greatest good came
to Spohr from hearing his teacher play.
<p>
In 1804 he made his first tour and aroused genuine
enthusiasm as a player and composer. In 1805 he
married Dorette Scheidler, a harpist, and with her
made further tours in 1807 and 1809.
<p>
Spohr's compositions run into the hundreds. They
include operas, symphonies and all the smaller forms
from octettes and quartettes down to songs.
<h4>741 Barcarolle</h4>
In this little piece for the violin we have a good
example of Spohr's exquisite melody. One of
his chief characteristics is his painstaking workmanship.
In this respect, he was surpassed by
no one except perhaps Mendelssohn. The simplicity
and innate beauty of this barcarolle are unsurpassed.
<h3>STAMPER, Dave</h3>
<h4>704 Sally, Won't You Come Back? from "Ziegfeld Follies of 1921"</h4>
In our efforts to supply our clients with the
latest and best in dance music we have hit upon
this fascinating thing from the "Ziegfeld
Follies." It is characteristic and fully up to the
high standard of a Ziegfeld show. 
<h3>STEBBINS, Charles A.</h3>
This organist and composer was born in Chicago, and
studied organ there with Harrison Wilde. Later he
studied organ with Gaston Dethier and theory with
Percy Goetschius at the Institute of Musical Art,
New York, receiving a diploma. He is at present an
organist in Chicago. His compositions are numerous,
including a number for the organ, piano and many songs.
<h4>507 Festival Piece</h4>
This is in reality a majestic march from the pen
of a man whose genuine musicianship is conspicuous
in every measure he writes. It is a
big conception, skillfully handled and appropriately named.
<h4>571 The Swan</h4>
One of the finest ethereal effects possible is to
be found in this charming little thing. It suggests
Wagner's propensity for writing three and
four-part harmony for the violins in the
upper registers. It is also slightly reminiscent of
Grieg. It is not like anything by Grieg, by any
means, but it seems to betray a very intimate
knowledge of the Norwegian composer. Perhaps
its greatest resemblance is in form. In any
event, it is lovely in the extreme, and nothing
could reveal the soft tones of the organ to better
advantage.
<h4>607 Where Dusk Gathers Deep</h4>
We have already catalogued two charming
pieces by C. A. Stebbins; namely, "In Summer"
and "The Swan," and both have been well
received. Being an organist, Stebbins, with his
fine gift of melody, writes delightfully for his
adapted instrument. His harmonies leave nothing
to be desired and the result is always a
worth-while effort. "Where Dusk Gathers
Deep" is a quiet, dreamy thing of great melodious beauty.
<h4>614 At Twilight</h4>
Here is a melody which is full of grace and
sentiment. A better description of it could not
be given than the verse which accompanies the
title:
<p>
Afar in the distance, the evening star gleams,<br>
And dim music drifts through the dusk of our dreams,<br>
While low murmur lute-strings, and soft sounds the sweep<br>
Of swaying tree-tops in the garden of sleep. 
<h3>STEBBINS, G. Waring 1869-</h3>
The subject of this paragraph was the son of George
C. Stebbins, the famous hymn writer and coworker
with Moody and Sankey. He was born at East Carlton,
New York, June 16, 1869. Nothing was spared
on his musical education. He studied organ and composition
with Guilmant and others, and voice with
Sbriglia, Henschel and others. He has held many
important posts as an organist and is well known as a
recitalist. Since his return from Europe he has devoted
his entire time to teaching singing. His compositions
number about sixty organ pieces, numerous
songs and choral compositions.
<h4>609 Cantilena</h4>
This is a fascinating cantilena dedicated to the
composer's teacher, Guilmant. It has a gorgeous
middle part which works up to a stirring
climax with full organ. The first theme reappears
with a bewitching obligato on the flute,
bringing to a close a most delectable composition.
<h4>611 A Memory</h4>
A wistful sort of thing by G. W. Stebbins. It
really seems to put one in a reminiscent mood.
Whether this is imagination or not is of little
consequence-the fact remains that it is a
charming piece.
<h3>STEVENSON, Frederick 1845-</h3>
Tkis composer, conductor and teacher was born in
Newark, Nottinghamshire, England, September 6,
1845. He received a college education and studied
choir work with Dr. Dearls, organ with Samuel Reay.
harmony with Dr. Macfarren and counterpoint with
Dr. Bridge. He taught composition and singing in
London for fifteen years. Since coming to the United
States he has taught in Denver ten years, Los Angeles
twenty years, and Santa Barbara, Calif., three years.
Many and various are his compositiona. They include
a cantata, "Easter Eve and Morn," a motet, "Omnipotence,"
and many sacred songs, also a number of
secular choruses, songs and part-songs.
<h4>496 Vision Fugitive</h4>
This is somewhat of a departure from the usual
short organ number, and the innovation is altogether
pleasing. It has no definite form, but
has a very well-designed theme which is cleverly
developed into a very charming bit of organ music.
<h3>STOLZ, Robert</h3>
<h4>696 Sal-O-May (Salome), Fox Trot</h4>
From time to time it becomes necessary to cut
a few rolls of dance music for those of our
clients who are also disciples of Terpsichore. 
We try to select for such purposes only pieces
of established popularity. Here we have a fox
trot which has proven its worth for dance purposes.
The organ arrangement is full of orchestral
effects and is eminently satisfactory.
<h3>STOUGHTON, Roy Spaulding</h3>
Roy Spaulding Stoughton is a native of Worcester,
Mass. He is one of the most promising of present day
composers. His work is distinctly modern, but
not painfully so. Indeed, he shows remarkable restraint
in the use of the material he chooses as a
medium for expressing his musical ideal. Many a
man, using the same material, would produce nothing
short of an atrocity. At times Stoughton startles,
but only for an instant. He never shocks. The use
of the old ecclesiastical modes or scales lends a color
to his compositions which could be obtained by no
other means. His works--nearly all of them--necessarily
have an exotic flavor, and they are invariably
fascinating. They are delightful in the extreme.
<h4>494 Cantus Adoratio</h4>
This is a composition for the organ by a man
who has written much for the instrument of his
choice. It is melodious, and possesses a charming
rhythm. 
<h4>499 Within a Chinese Garden</h4>
This composer has a remarkable penchant for
themes of an exotic nature, and has done much
along these lines.
<p>
This particular number has a peculiarly charming
rhythm, and a melody of distinct beauty.
As a sort of introduction there are four measures
of consecutive fourths, which, aside from
the rhythm, produce a strange effect, and adequately
prepare the ear for what is to follow.
Now comes a really enchanting theme on the
oboe, which gives way to a duet on the flutes,
after which the oboe theme recurs, as does also
the whole first part, bringing to a close an especially
attractive composition.
<h4>502 Nocturne</h4>
A nocturne from the pen of a man possessed of
a gift of melody such as this composer has,
could hardly be anything but a delight. The
first requisite of this form is an easy-flowing
tune, and here we have it. It moves along with
the required grace, and the composer has wisely
clothed it with the simplest harmonies, producing
a splendid balance between melody and
accompaniment. 
<h4>511 An Eastern Idyl</h4>
This is an especially attractive Oriental conceit,
-a quaint and curious tune which was
home grown but smacks no less of the desert
and caravansary.
<h4>524 By the Ganges</h4>
<h4>525 The Dancing Girls of Delhi</h4>
Here are two numbers from the suite "In
India," by a composer who revels in the atmosphere
produced by the use of the old ecclesiastical
modes or scales. Much skill is displayed
also in the selection of suitable rhythm, and the
combinations of unusual intervals and unique
rhythm have, in the case of this composer, resulted
in some delightful music which is reminiscent
of nothing else. Both of these numbers
are splendid examples of strange but beautiful music.
<h4>572 Ancient Phoenician Procession</h4>
The name of this number would indicate that it
is a sort of a march of an Oriental or at least
exotic flavor, and it is all its name indicates.
But little imagination is needed to produce a
mental picture of a gaudily costumed and 
stately procession, moving with measured and 

dignified step.
<p> 

It is the sort of a thing that Stoughton does best, 

and is extremely fascinating. 

<h4>586 The Courts of Jamshyd</h4>
<h4>587 The Garden of Iram</h4>
<h4>588 Saki</h4>
These three numbers form the "Persian Suite
for Organ." This Suite has become very popular
in its entirety. All the numbers measure up
to what we have learned to expect from the pen
of Stoughton. He rarely writes in a strictly
orthodox manner. He likes peculiar rhythms
and harmonies, and it is not strange that he
does, for he writes them well. This Suite is a
charming composition, and it is Oriental-a
statement which may not be truthfully made
concerning many things bearing an Oriental title.
<h4>668 Dreams</h4>
A very appropriately named little thing for the
organ is this. It is mysterious, but yet seems
to have a definite purpose. The mystery lies
in finding the purpose. It is a most charming
bit of writing. 
<h3>STRAUSS, Johann</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume I)
<h4>404 Thousand and One Night Waltz</h4>
The irresistible rhythm of this waltz has caused
it to take its place beside "The Beautiful Blue
Danube" as a standard-indeed a classic. The
waltz rhythm has an inherent fascination and
from the workshop of a Strauss there could
come nothing short of a gem when a dance form
was chosen as a medium of expression.
The Strauss waltzes are as seductive and fascinating
as ever and their popularity is never
threatened-verily, they grow in esteem as time
goes on.
<h4>664 Vienna Life (Waltz)</h4>
Strauss waltzes are always welcome. For genuine
tunefulness nothing surpasses them. One
would think that Strauss' supply of melodic
material would have been exhausted long before
he finished the hundreds of dance pieces he
wrote. It was not, however, for the same characteristic
charm is present in all of them. The
"Vienna Life" or "Wiener Blut," as it is in the
German, is no exception. 
<h3>STRAUSS, Richard</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volwme 1)
<h4>710a and b, Tod und Verklarung (Death and Transfiguration), (two rolls)</h4>
What may be regarded as an adequate description
of this tone poem is found in the poem by
Ritter which Strauss has used as a preface to
the printed score of "Tod und Verklarung."
Lack of space precludes the printing here of
the entire poem, and a condensed version would
not do it justice.
<p>
For our purposes we cannot do better than to
quote from "Stories of Symphonic Music" by
Lawrence Gilman:
<p>
"We see the sick man lying exhausted upon his
bed in the little candle-lit room: he has just
wrestled wildly with Death. He smiles faintly,
dreaming of his youth.
<p>
"Abruptly, Death renews the attack, and the
dreadful struggle is resumed. There is a gradual
exhaustion, and once more a respite comes
to the sufferer.
<p>
"Now he is visited by dreams and hallucinations
-memories of youth, of young manhood and its
vicissitudes, of lusty conflict and passionate 
endeavor, with illusory glimpses of future 

triumph.
<p> 

"But again Death attacks his victim. There is 

a short and furious struggle, a sudden subsidence,
a mysterious and sinister gong-stroke; a 

portentous silence signifies the final stilling of 

the heart.
<p> 

"Then begins, gradually and gravely, the 

Transfiguration; and the final triumphant attainment
of the soul released." 

<h4>715 Till Eulenspiegel's Lustige Streiche</h4>
Tyl Owlglass (his English name) is the prank playing
vagabond hero of a fifteenth-century
German Volksbuch whose authorship is attributed
to Dr. Thomas Murner (1475-1530).
Till, according to Dr. Murner, was born at
Kneithlinger, Brunswick, in 1283, and died of
the plague at Moln in 1350 or 1353.
<p>
Till's exploits, the stories of which are household
words in Germany, consisted of mischievous
pranks and jests that he practiced without
discrimination and, in some instances, with a
frank and joyous absence of delicate sentiment.
Strauss declined to furnish a description or
elucidation of his music on the ground that it
would seldom suffice and might offend.
<p>
He has, however, apparently given his sanction
to an analysis of the score by Mr. Wilhelm
Klatte. An English translation of this analysis
has been made by Mr. C. A. Barry, from which
we epitomize the following:
<p>
Here he is. He wanders through the land as
a thoroughgoing adventurer. His clothes are
tattered and torn.
<p>
The rogue, putting on his best manners, slyly
passes through the gate and enters the city. It
is market day; the women sit at their stalls and
prattle. Eulenspiegel springs on his horse,
gives a smack of his whip and rides into the
midst of the crowd. Click, clash, clatter! A
confused sound of broken pots and pans, and
the market women are put to flight. The rascal
rides away to a safe retreat.
<p>
This was his first merry prank; a second follows,
immediately. He puts on the garb of a priest.
He does not feel comfortable in his borrowed
plumes. Away with all scruples! He tears
them off.
<p>
Again the Eulenspiegel theme is heard in the
same lively tempo, but now subtly metamorphosed.
Till has become a Don Juan and waylays
pretty women. One has bewitched him. 
He is in love, but in vain. His advances are
repulsed and he goes away in a rage. Vengeance
on the whole human race!
<p>
Eulenspiegel's insolence knows no bounds, he
is a merry jester, a born liar. He goes wherever
he can succeed with a hoax. Alas! there is
a sudden jolt to his wanton humor. The drum
rolls a hollow roll; the jailer drags his rascally
prisoner into the criminal court. The verdict
guilty is pronounced against the knave. He
does not confess. He lies. His jig is up.
<p>
Fear seizes him. The fatal moment draws near;
his hour has struck! . . . He has danced in
air. A last struggle and his soul takes flight
and Eulenspiegel has become a legendary character.
<h3>SUPPE, Franz von</h3>
(For Biographkal Sketch ace Catalogue. Volume 1)
<h4>634 Light Cavalry Overture</h4>
There are no more popular overtures in the
lighter vein than those of Suppe. They deserve
to be popular for they are good music and
have a distinct place in music literature. Suppe
had a remarkable gift of both melody and 
rhythm-the first essentials in successful composition.
He was also a good workman and
possessed a splendid knowledge of the orchestra.
Thus equipped, it is little wonder that all of his
overtures have attained popular favor. We
shall adapt more of these charming overtures
to the organ.
<h4>636 Overture, Morning, Noon and Night in Vienna</h4>
This is another of the fine concert overtures of
Suppe. Like all of the others, it is tuneful in
the extreme, and the thematic material is skillfully
arranged. It shares with "Poet and Peasant,"
"Light Cavalry" and "Pique Dame" a
degree of popularity exceeded by nothing in
their class. It is extremely effective on the
organ.
<h4>643 Overture, Pique Dame</h4>
This is one of the many overtures by Suppe
which are known in this country only as concert
numbers. All of Suppe's overtures are in a
light vein but are well written and tuneful. This
and the "Light Cavalry Overture" share with
"Poet and Peasant" an immense amount of
public esteem. 
<h3>SWINNEN, Firmin</h3>
<h4>606 Chinoiserie</h4>
Firmin Swinnen has few equals and no superiors
as a theatre organist. He has a marvelous
technique and a charming temperament.
A man so equipped could not but write well.
We have seen a number of his arrangements
and have made rolls of them, and have longed
for something original from his pen. The first
thing we have found is this Chinese tune
"Chinoiserie," and it is delightful. It is wonderfully
characteristic and truly smacks of its exotic origin.
<h4>671 Soir d'Automne</h4>
An autumn evening would likely inspire just
such a tune as this. It is quiet, peaceful, placid,
serene, unassuming and undemonstrative. It
is good music by an exceptionally fine organist.
We are sure our patrons will enjoy it.
<h3>SZALIT, Paula</h3>
<h4>679 Intermezzo</h4>
The purpose of an intermezzo is supposed to
be to bridge a gap between two more important
events. This one, however, needs no such excuse
for its being. It is able to stand alone and
command attention as a distinctly beautiful
piece of music. It is by Paula Szalit, concerning
whom we are unable at this time to give any
information.
<h3>TOURS, Berthold 1838-1897</h3>
Berthold Tours is very generally comidered an English
musician. He was born at Rotterdam, but his
long residence in London-from 1861 until his death
caused him to be classified as an English musician.
He was a violinist, but is known in this country only
as a composer. In 1878 he became musical adviser
and editor to Novello and Company. His works are
numerous, he having written many songs and anthems,
as well as pieces for the piano, violin, etc.
<h4>481 Allegretto Grazioso</h4>
Tours' work never startles, yet is never so obvious
as to be commonplace. It is always good,
solid, wholesome music. He had a fine melodic
instinct, and had enough of the technique of
composition to clothe his melodies with well fitting
harmonies. This allegretto is full of
grace and charm and possesses a degree of
musical solidity which might well be aimed at
by many present-day composers. 
<h3>TSCHAIKOWSKY, Peter Iljitch</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue. Volume I)
<h4>389 Overture from "Nut Cracker Suite"</h4>
Every number of this famous orchestral suite
is superlatively charming. Never did Tschaikowsky's
ingenuity come to the surface with
greater force. He liked at times to throw tradition
to the winds, and give himself free rein,
and in this latter overture we have one of the
most exquisite examples of spontaneity extant.
It is by no means an example of unadorned
beauty. Indeed, the framework approaches
the commonplace. It is the remarkable embellishments
which give it its charm.
<p>
A curious fact concerning this wonderful bit of
orchestral scoring is that he has used neither
'cellos nor basses, the strings consisting entirely
of violins and violas.
<h4>390 "Danse Arabe" from "Nut Cracker Suite"</h4>
The Oriental atmosphere in this little dance is
so evident that it scarcely requires a name.
The incessant tom-tom rhythm, the weird harmony,
and the peculiarly Oriental melody, all 
combine to complete an ensemble which is highly
satisfactory.
<h4>470 Humoreske</h4>
This is a very characteristic bit of writing which
is filled with humor. It is Tschaikowsky in a
happy mood and therefore a somewhat rare
mood. He was a rather morbid creature, but
when he was in a playful humor he scintillated,
as this little thing will attest.
<h4>476 Chant sans Paroles, Op. 40, No.6</h4>
Like much of Tschaikowsky's music, this song
without words is in a minor key, and like many
other compositions from his pen it has a plaintive
quality, and seems almost an expression of
sadness. While sombre, this piece is no less
interesting, and is such a thing as is apt to produce
a reflective mood in the mind of the listener.
<h4>480 Melodie, Op. 42, No.3</h4>
Next to the violin, the organ is the best instrument
upon which to playa violin solo. Nothing 
could be more pleasing than the organ rendition
of this wonderful little thing from the roll. The
Estey string stops are noted for their faithful
reproduction of string quality, and this roll
fully demonstrates the reason. It would be
difficult to find anything more lovely than this
number. It is in the repertoire of all the great
violin masters, and the organ rendition suffers
not at all by comparison.
<h4>546 Chanson Triste</h4>
Among the best-known and frequent moods of
Tschaikowsky is that of sadness. He had only
a limited fund of humor and he seems about to
have exhausted it in the charming "Nut Cracker
Suite." His sixth symphony, the "Pathetique,"
is an example of his best work, and it bears from
beginning to end an unmistakable tinge of gloom.
<p>
In this number he has set down the simplest
melody conceivable, and the accompaniment is
a mere harmonic scaffold of the most unpretentious
character, yet nothing could be more
beautiful. It is in complete sympathy with a
mood in which we all find ourselves at times, and
it so completely expresses our feelings at such
times as to make one feel that he is expressing
himself in his own way. 
<h4>550 Allegro con Grazia from Pathetique Symphony</h4>
Here is Tschaikowsky in one of his delightful
moods. A more graceful or charming theme
would be hard to find. It is extremely unique,
being in 5-4 time, but this strange rhythm adds
to its charm. It is Tschaikowsky at his best.
More than this need not be said.
<h4>563 October from "The Seasons"</h4>
Tschaikowsky's set of pieces for piano, "The
Seasons," is so well known as to require no
comment. Each is a gem. The adaptation of
October was a happy thought. It fits the organ
as though made for it, and is indeed a thing of
greater charm than the original conception.
<h4>564 Troika en Traineaux from "The Seasons"</h4>
This number occupies the place in "The Seasons"
which should be allotted to November,
had Tschaikowsky chosen to give it the name of
a month as he did with all the others in the set
of twelve. 
It is evidently a sleigh ride. In Russia they
have a fashion of hitching three horses to a sled
(troika), two of them trot while the other runs
or gallops. Certain places in this composition
seem to indicate the two distinct rhythms of the
two gaits.
<p>
Indeed, one can imagine a lot of things with such
a delightful thing as this to serve as prompter.
It is full of effervescent joy throughout, something
unusual for Tschaikowsky. It is a pleasure
to find him in a joyous mood.
<h4>674 Barcarole, June, from "The Seasons"</h4>
Of all the work of Tschaikowsky, nothing is
known better than this barcarole. The reason
for its popularity is not hard to find, for it is
superlatively beautiful. Tschaikowsky wrote
twelve numbers which he named after the twelve
months, and called them collectively "The Seasons."
This barcarole is June. It was, of
course, written for the piano, but it has lost
nothing in being fitted to the organ; indeed, it
has gained much, for as the roll gives it, it has
a wealth of tone color which is missing in the
original. We commend it to all lovers of beautiful
music. 
<h3>VERDI, Giuseppe</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue. Volume 1)
<h4>366 Aida Fantasie No. 1</h4>
This revolutionary operatic work had its premier
production at Cairo, Egypt, on December
24, 1871. It was written at the instance of
Ismail Pasha, Khedive of Egypt. The Khedive
had built a new opera house at Cairo. He was
a patron of art, and to further fulfill his desire
to appear before the world as such, importuned
Verdi to write an opera to be produced first in
the opera house which he had built. Verdi was
not enthusiastic over the proposal, but instead
of refusing absolutely, made a price which he
thought would dissuade the Khedive from his
project. To Verdi's surprise, however, the
Khedive at once accepted the terms.
<p>
The Khedive intrusted the finding of a suitable
libretto to Auguste Edouard Mariette, the eminent
French Egyptologist.
<p>
The story is founded on an incident in Egyptian
history, found by Mariette, who developed the
original plan of the libretto. This diagram was
handed to M. Camille du Loele, who wrote the
recitative and lyrics at Verdi's house at Busseto,
Italy, having the benefit of the composer's
practical advice. It is indeed a fact that Verdi
had much to do with the preparation of the 
libretto which was to inspire one of the greatest
of operas.
<p>
Once at work, Verdi's indifference changed to
enthusiasm and he set about to excel his past
operatic efforts, and time has proclaimed him.
victor.
<p>
The best-known portions of the opera have been
selected for the roll, including the famous
"Celeste Aida."
<h4>410 Selections from Rigoletto</h4>
Most of the best-known and favorite numbers
from this well-known opera appear on this roll,
which is sure to give unbounded pleasure to
opera goers. The popularity of certain numbers
of Rigoletto will never wane as long as
there is a Ruffo, Amato, Martinelli, Tetrazzini
or Galli-Curci.
<p>
Baritone, tenor and soprano are the voices favored
in this opera, and most of the numbers
given by this roll are sung by these voices. Certain
choral numbers are also included.
Rigoletto has long served as a vehicle for the
exploitation of some new star, but the real reason
for its hold on the musical public is its inherent
worth-a statement proven by the fact that
the opera is so often given in its entirety. 

<h3>VINCENT, George F.</h3>
<h4>620 Meditation Symphonique</h4>
The composer of this delightful piece has made
the suggestion that the stops used should be as
imitative of the orchestra as possible. As the
imitative character of Estey Organs is well
known and appreciated, it was easy in the
making of the roll to conform to his wishes.
This meditation is essentially orchestral in style,
and we have been able to produce some striking
orchestral effects. The first subject is heard
alone in the first two measures on the 'cellos and
basses. The treatment is in regular sonata
form and is full of charming tonal effects ranging
from the string choir alone to the full organ.
<h3>WAGNER, Wilhelm Richard</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>438 Vorspiel to Parsifal</h4>
As is well known, Parsifal is a three-act opera
- rather a music drama-the poem and music by
Richard Wagner. The poem was published in
1877, but the music was not completed until
1879. It was first produced at Bayreuth on
July 28, 1882, and for twenty-one years was not 
heard elsewhere except in concert form under
Barnby at Albert Hall, London, November 10, 1903.
<p>
Wagner desired, of course, that Parsifal and
others of his operas should never be staged anywhere
but at Bayreuth, and there are certain
good reasons for this desire so far as Parsifal is
concerned. However, after many serious disputes
between American managers and the
Bayreuth authorities, Parsifal was given its first
complete performance outside of the theatre
built for it, in the Metropolitan Opera House,
New York, on December 24, 1903, with Alfred
Hertz as conductor.
<p>
The present roll contains the Vorspiel, or prelude
to Parsifal. The limited space available
here precludes a dissertation on the programme
of the music. This can be found in any of the
many works on Wagnerian opera. It will
suffice to state that the roll gives the music in a
highly satisfactory manner, and that it will be
enjoyed by all admirers of Wagner.
<h4>520 Overture to Rienzi</h4>
Rienzi was the first of what may be called
Wagner's successful operas. Two acts of it
were written at Riga and Mitau, in 1838 and 
1839. Acts 3, 4 and 5 were written in Paris in
1840. It was first performed at Dresden,
October 20, 1842, and is today a favorite opera
in that city.
<p>
Rienzi is rarely given in this country, but the
overture is a great favorite as a concert number.
The thematic material in the overture is
practically all from the opera, including Rienzi's
Prayer, the chorus from the finale of the first
act, the Battle Hymn and the finale of the
second act.
<h4>534 Overture to Meistersingers</h4>
Wagner made sketches of this opera as early as
1845, but the poem was not really begun until
the winter of 1861-1862 at Paris. The music
was begun in 1862 and finished in 1867. The
first performance took place at Munich, June
21, 1868, under von Bulow, with Wagner personally
supervising everything.
<p>
The Overture-or Vorspiel-is a wonderfully
clever arrangement of themes from the opera.
It savors not a whit of a potpourri. The themes
have been so skillfully welded together as to
never suggest anything but a natural sequence
of musical ideas. The roll gives this wonderful
music a most artistic performance. 
<h4>602 Elizabeth's Prayer, Tannhauser</h4>
To opera goers, the setting of this prayer is
familiar. It occurs in the third act. Elizabeth
is kneeling at the shrine, praying for the salvation
of Tannhauser, who had gone to Rome to
do penance. A band of pilgrims from Rome appears.
Elizabeth discontinues her devotion long
enough to scan their faces, and not seeing Tannhauser
among them, she raises her voice in supplication.
<h4>719 Siegfried Idyll</h4>
In writing to a friend about the birth of his
son Siegfried, Wagner said, "She has borne to
me a wonderfully beautiful and vigorous boy,
whom I could boldly call Siegfried; he is now
growing, together with my work, and giving me
a long new life (Wagner was then fifty-seven
years old), which has at last attained a meaning.
Thus we get along without the world, from
which we have retired entirely."
<p>
The Siegfried Idyll was presented to Madam
Wagner as a birthday present, and was first
performed on the steps of Wagner's Villa at
Triebschen. The orchestra was a small group
of players gathered from the neighborhood and
was conducted by Wagner. 
<p>
The themes out of which the Idyll is evolved, are
with one exception from the Nibelungen music drama,
upon which Wagner was at work when
his son was born. The exception is a German
cradle song.
<p>
Wagner displays his wonderful genius in weaving
together the themes, and has produced a
concert number of superlative beauty.
<h4>726 Ride of the Valkyries, Die Walkure</h4>
Professor George T. Dippold, in his book on
the Ring, thus describes the Ride of the
Valkyries:
<p>
"The third act of the 'Walkure' represents a
scene of uncommon beauty and interest. To the
right appears the beginning of a forest of fir
trees; to the left opens the entrance to a cavern
in the rocks. Above this, the cliffs attain their
highest point; toward the background, huge
rocks are supposed to lead toward a steep abyss.
Clouds, driven by the storm, sweep by the mountains.
The region is the gathering place of the
Valkyrs, the so-called 'Walkuren Stein,' or rock
of the Valkyrs. At the rise of the curtain, four
of the Valkyrs are seen on the point of a rock
near and above the cavern. With helmet, shield 
and spear and glittering coat of mail over the
long flowing dress, they await the coming of
their sisters. A sudden blaze of lightning flashes
through one of the clouds passing by, and in it
is seen a Valkyr on horseback, the form of a
slain warrior hanging across her saddle. Again
a flash of lightning displays another Valkyr,
until at last eight of the nine are assembled.
Laughingly they greet each other and glory in
their warlike deeds. The music portrays their
wild flight through the air, the clash of arms,
the neighing of the steeds and the laughter of
the maidens, while the exulting Valkyr cry of
'Hoyotoho!' resounds from the lips of the
warrior maids."
<h4>728 Waldweben, from Siegfried</h4>
This is an excerpt from Wagner's music-drama
"Siegfried" which is often played as a separate
orchestral number. It is that wonderfully
beautiful bit of music from the second act while
the hero is lying Imder the tree in the forest.
The music represents the murmuring of the
leaves. The song of a bird is also heard. It is
a highly poetic piece of writing and the organ
is second only to the orchestra in its rendition. 
<h3>WEST, John A.</h3>
John A. West has for many years been a prominmt
Chicago organist. He was born in 1853 in Oriskany.
N. Y. Very early in life his musical talent came to the
surface and he was organist of a church at the tender
age of twelve years. He has composed for the instrument
of his choice much which has received favor.
<h4>413 Melody</h4>
Here is a bit of melody which is charming in its
simplicity. The tune is one that clings after
once heard, and seems to have been written more
for the 'cello or voice than the organ. The
organ rendition from the roll, however, leaves
no yearning - except to hear it again.
<h3>WEST, John E. 1863-</h3>
John Ebenezer West was born in London. December
7, 1863. His musical education was obtained at the
Royal Academy of Music, under Dr. Bridge and
Ebenezer Prout. His compositions are many, including
two cantatas, a setting of the One Hundred
and Thirtieth Psalm, an overture to Longfellow's
"King Robert of Sicily," evening services, a Te Deum,
numerous anthems, part-songs, organ music, songs, etc.
<h4>688 Festal Commemoration</h4>
It would seem that a festal commemoration
should be a joyous sort of a thing, and that is
just what it is - at least in this case. This is a
sterling composition conceived on a big plan
and developed With consummate skill. Above
all, it is extremely musical.
<h4>689 Postlude in B flat</h4>
There are postludes and postludes! Some are
evidently designed to drive people out of church,
but this one is different: it is of the sort which
makes the audience gather round in informal
groups and listen until the organist has finished.
Not even a good dinner would tempt them to
leave. It is nothing short of fascinating.
<h3>WHEELDON, Herbert Arthur 1864</h3>
This composer's reputation is built almost entirely
upon his compositions for the organ. He has written
little for any other instrument. Born in Derby, England,
in 1864, he held, many important positions in
the land of his birth as organist. In 1907 he accepted
the post of organist of the Metropolitan Church,
Toronto, Canada, where he soon became famous for
his organ recitals.
<p>
His published numbers for the organ include numerous
forms, and are extremely popular with recitalists and
churchgoers. They all betray a keen and sound musicianship.
<h4>444 Oriental Intermezzo</h4>
Here is a delightful tune with a decidedly Eastern
atmosphere. Like most Oriental music, it
is in a minor key, and it possesses many other
characteristics common to music of this sort. In
this particular number the composer was fortunate
in his choice of thematic material, and his
usual good workmanship is present from beginning
to end.
<h4>447 Evening Chimes</h4>
Starting off with a conventional phrase on the
chimes, which is immediately repeated in a
faster tempo, the composer proceeds at once to
weave about the chime phrase a most beautiful
musical fabric. After a few measures the
chimes give way to the strings, which hold sway
until it is time for the chimes to reappear, which
they do at the proper time.
<p>
The middle section is a delightful duet, and is a
sprightly and charming theme. A very effective
climax furnishes the necessary modulation
of the original key, when the first part is repeated
as a closing theme. 
<h4>566 Grand Choeur</h4>
This postlude is a favorite among organists and
recital attendants. It is big in conception, and
is an altogether satisfactory composition. In
the arrangement of the roll, advantage has been
taken of the opportunity for tone color, which
adds much to the charm of a splendid piece of
writing. The sterling musicianship of the composer
is evident throughout the whole number.
<h4>677 Postlude in D</h4>
We have listed other compositions by Wheeldon
and the fact that they have all been well received
is responsible for the issuing of this delightful
postlude. It is full of color and in splendid
form. The workmanship leaves nothing to be desired.
<h4>681 Cantique du Matin</h4>
This is a splendid piece both inelodically and
harmonically. The theme is unusual and the
workmanship that of a master. There is a most
interesting middle part in which the first theme
is used as a counterpoint for an entirely new
theme. In this middle part the skill of the
composer is well demonstrated. The composition
concludes with a further working out of
the original theme.
<h3>WIDOR, Charles Marie</h3>
France has been the birthplace of many great organists,
notably, Guilmant, Dubois, Wely, Saint-Saens,
Franck and many others, including the subject of this
paragraph, Charles Marie Widor.
<p>
Widor was born at Lyons, February 22, 1845. He
began his studies with his father, who was organist at
St. Francois, Lyons, and continued at the Brussels
Conservatory under the great Lemmens and Fetis. In
1870 he became organist at St. Sulpice, Paris. His
great musicianship was at once recognized, and an appointment
to the Professorship of Organ at the Paris
Conservatoire eventuated upon the retirement of Cesar
Franck - no greater compliment could have been paid
him than to be asked to succeed so great a man.
<p>
Widor is noted also for his work as a writer on musical
matters, and his "critiques" in the "Estafette" are
notable efforts.
<p>
He is a prolific composer, having written in all the
accepted forms, including many songs, duets, string
and pianoforte trios, quartettes and quintettes, symphonies
for organ, and also two for orchestra.
<h4>418 Scherzando Humoreske</h4>
If any importance is to be attached to titles, this
somewhat diminutive composition should be of
a jovial, jocular character. In this case the
title is not a misnomer. A more humorous,
facetious, droll or comical conceit would be
hard to find. The trio is particularly waggish,
with its sustained accompaniment and a strikingly
impudent tune underneath.
<p>
Taken all in all, it is a bewitching little composition,
and source of much delight to possessors
of the roll.
<h4>467 Minuet from Third Symphony</h4>
Certain disputatious persons have claimed that
a symphony cannot be written for the organ because
the term implies a sonata for a full orchestra.
This claim, however, is not well founded,
for the obvious reason that a pipe organ is not
a single instrument. Then, too, sonatas are not
nowadays written for a single instrument (except
the piano) and have not been for many
years. Bach, Handel and their contemporaries
wrote sonatas for violin alone and for 'cello
alone, but few, if any, have been written since
their time for any instrument without an accompaniment
of some sort.
<p>
The fact that it is possible for one person to play
a composition in the sonata form on a large
number of instruments at one time, should not,
and as a matter of fact does not, make said composition
any less a symphony than if a number
of men had been used to produce a similar result.
We, therefore, conclude that Widor was
well within his rights when he chose to call them
symphonies. Furthermore, they are symphonic
in form and scope. 
<p>
This minuet is one of bewitching daintiness and
is a fair sample of Widor's technique of composition.
It has the stately rhythm so characteristic
of the minuets of the classic composers.
The atmosphere of powdered wigs, pannier
skirts, silver buckles, silken hose, satin breeches
and lace-trimmed coats, beauty spots, etc., permeates
it. It is a thing of beauty. The roll
plays it in a manner likely to make the best organists
envious, and leaves nothing to be desired.
<h4>485 Scherzo from Second Symphony</h4>
Here is a rollicking tune which is as full of jollity
and mischief as one could wish. It is rather
unusual in form-at least from a classic point
of view-in that it has no trio. There is plenty
of precedent, however, for this omission, but
if there were not, Widor was too big a man to
be bound by conventionalities. The symphony
from which this Scherzo is taken was written
for the organ, and the roll does it superlatively.
<h4>537 Scherzo from Fourth Symphony</h4>
Here is an exquisite example of fairylike music
which baffles description. It sparkles, scintillates,
glitters, yet withal there is a vein of droll 
humor which is never absent nor obvious. It is
superlative in its beauty. The symphony from
which it is taken was of course written for the
organ, which means that the roll leaves nothing
to be desired.
<h4>539 Andante Cantabile from Fourth Symphony</h4>
Ever since the invention of the sonata form, it
has been a matter of pride among composers to
write a slow movement which they could look
upon with satisfaction-with a feeling that they
had done something really worth while. Indeed,
a quartette or symphony is often judged by its
slow movement.
<p>
There are all kinds of slow movements. Mozart
was fond of highly ornate development of his
thematic material, sometimes perhaps carrying
his development a little too far, but his workmanship
was always exquisite. Beethoven often
used the simplest possible tune for a theme,
followed by a series of charming variations.
Tschaikowsky in the immortal slow movement
of the String Quartette, Op. 11, has used neither
of these methods, but has relied solely upon the
native beauty of the folk song chosen for a 
theme and the gorgeousness of the harmonies
with which he has clothed it.
<p>
In the slow movement of the Fourth Organ
Symphony, Widor has chosen a theme of great
simplicity and beauty which is good enough to
stand alone. There is no embellishment except
in the accompaniment the second time the theme
appears. The modesty of the whole thing is its
greatest charm.
<h4>646 Cantabile from Sixth Symphony</h4>
Widor wrote eight symphonies for the organ.
All of them have their favorite movements. The
present roll contains the Cantabile from the
Sixth Symphony-a favorite with recitalists.
That it is a charming composition is evident
upon first hearing. It is cast in a mould of
classic beauty. Widor's gift of melody is in evidence
as well as his superlative workmanship.
<h4>648 Allegro from Sixth Symphony</h4>
This is a first movement cast in the regular
sonata mould. The theme is immediately announced
in massive chords. After a more or less
indefinite interlude, which foreshadows the second
theme, a fragment of the first theme is
heard. Then the second theme and the development
blossom forth in the inimitable Widor fashion.
<p>
It is massive in conception and the workmanship
is fully up to the Widor standard-which is
about all that need be said in its praise.
<h4>654 Intermezzo, Sixth Symphony, Third Movement</h4>
This Intermezzo might have been aptly termed
"Scherzo." It is as full of jollity as anything
could be; indeed, at times it seems almost
humorous. Whatever the mood portrayed - and
that is a matter of opinion - it is a delightful
composition.
<p>
Its position in the symphony from which it is
taken, is between the adagio and the cantabile - two
slow movements - and what a beautiful
contrast it makes! The "Cantabile," which
is roll No. 646, may well be played after this
one, as was the composer's intent. We shall
complete the symphony in the near future.
Then the whole five movements may be played
in their regular order. 
<h4>684 Vivace, Finale, Sixth Symphony</h4>
This is the fourth movement of this symphony
that we have listed. Like the others, this movement
is orchestral in its conception and coloring.
It is ambitious and modern in its working
out, but not painfully so. It is always music
and while it is a ponderous thing, it is well
adapted to display the power of the organ. It
is never mere noise. Like most of Widor's
work, it is somewhat free in form and bears the
stamp of originality. Itshould by all means be
added to the library of all.
<h4>655 Serenade</h4>
The greatest of composers have at times delighted
in giving free rein to the muse, allowing
her to wander, aimlessly about. Here is a case
in point. This Serenade has no particular form
or design. It is simply a charming tune which
rambles about, going nowhere in particular. It
is delightful in its simplicity and a remarkable
example of restraint on the part of a man whose
technique of composition is unexcelled. 

<h3>WOLSTENHOLME, William</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>464 Cantilene</h4>
This cantilene is strikingly original, which statement
is as complimentary as anything that
could be said of it. It is most unusual in rhythm
and delightful in its treatment of thematic
material. The middle part is quite as unique in
rhythm as the first and serves as an appropriate
contrast. As is usual in this form, the first part
recurs and becomes the closing theme also.
<h4>500 Fantasie Rustique</h4>
Wolstenholme's work is always interesting, and
more often than not beautiful as well. In this
"Fantasie Rustique" are' combined all the elements
which are necessary to the making of
good music. In the organ, we have the medium
selected by the composer himself for its delivery.
The roll gives this exquisite composition
in a manner surpassing the work of all but the
very best organists, for its technical requirements
are such that but comparatively few
organists can play it at all acceptably. 
<h4>505 Allegro Militaire</h4>
This is in reality a polacca or polonaise, the
first name being Italian, and the last Polish for
the same thing. Polaccas are in 3-4 time and
are generally of a brilliant character. This one
is no exception to the rule.
<p>
Beginning with a pompous theme, it gets right
down to business and unfolds as brilliant and
charming a bit of organ music as one could wish
to hear. The middle part is scarcely less brilliant,
but in marked contrast to the first part,
which, with a short coda, effects a glittering
close.
<h4>650 The Question and the Answer</h4>
These two compositions are most happily
named. The "Question" is persistent and at
times emphatic. Just what the question is
about, is somewhat of a mystery. In any
event, it expresses a longing for something, and
a commendable determination to get it.
The "Answer" seems not only to suffice, but to
satisfy. Both are charming numbers and they
form a delightful little suite. 
<h4>685 Caprice</h4>
The blind organist who wrote this Caprice is
a man of many moods. He could at will, seemingly,
be sad or gay, dignified or capricious,
stately or whimsical. Here we have him in a
delightfully playful humor. He skips and runs
about from place to place, seeming to have no
definite objective. There is a period of quiet
restfulness in the middle, after which the play
is resumed. It is a splendid bit of writing and
grows in favor each time it is heard.
<h4>686 Grand Choeur in G Minor</h4>
Here is an example of dignified writing quite in
contrast with the Caprice by the same composer.
In it he has shown to good advantage his remarkable
gift of melody, and his technique of
composition as well. It is a big conception,
well planned and charmingly executed.
<h4>690 Concert Overture in F</h4>
Most of the organist composers have felt the
desire to write a concert overture for the instrument
of their choice. From Wolstenholme we
always expect something genuinely good and
we are rarely if ever disappointed. There is
nothing startling about this overture. It is
simply splendid in form and workmanship sterling
music in every sense. 
<h4>702 Reverie</h4>
A dreamy little thing by a French composer.
It was written as a violin solo. We have, therefore,
given the tune to the string stops. Organs
which contain the Estey harp will find it effectively
used in the accompaniment. The harp is
not, however, a necessity, for it is a delightful
piece without it.
<h3>YON, Pietro</h3>
(For Biographical Sketch see Catalogue, Volume 1)
<h4>497 Elegie</h4>
This is a highly original composition of much
beauty. It is a unique conception from any
point of view. In form only is it orthodox.
The theme is plaintive and of the sort that improves
with each hearing. The middle part is
in marked contrast and well prepares the mind
for the recurrence of the first theme, which is
repeated in its entirety. A short coda of four
measures brings it to a graceful close. 
<h4>540 Andante Rustico from Sonata Cromatica</h4>
This is the first movement of a sonata dedicated
to the famous French organist, Joseph Bonnet.
It is a great favorite with recitalists whose technical
equipment is adequate, and is also much
admired by the attendants at organ recitals. It
teems with vigor and virility, and bears the
stamp of genius.
<h4>541 Adagio Triste, Slow Movement from Sonata Cromatica</h4>
This is a remarkably plaintive melody. It is
anything but cheerful, but is nevertheless one
of the sort that one likes to hear at times, being
in marked contrast to the Andante Rustico of
the same sonata, which it follows.
