<h3 id="A81">81. The Crab and Its Mother</h3>

<p>A CRAB said to her son, &quot;Why do you walk so one-sided, my
child? It is far more becoming to go straight forward.&quot; The
young Crab replied: &quot;Quite true, dear Mother; and if you
will show me the straight way, I will promise to walk in it.&quot;
The Mother tried in vain, and submitted without remonstrance to
the reproof of her child.</p>

<p class="reditalic">Example is more powerful than precept.</p>

<h3 id="A82">82. The Heifer and the Ox</h3>

<p>A HEIFER saw an Ox hard at work harnessed to a plow, and
tormented him with reflections on his unhappy fate in being
compelled to labor. Shortly afterwards, at the harvest festival,
the owner released the Ox from his yoke, but bound the Heifer
with cords and led him away to the altar to be slain in honor of
the occasion. The Ox saw what was being done, and said with a
smile to the Heifer: &quot;For this you were allowed to live in
idleness, because you were presently to be sacrificed.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A83">83. The Swallow, the Serpent, and the Court of
Justice</h3>

<p>A SWALLOW, returning from abroad and especially fond of
dwelling with men, built herself a nest in the wall of a Court of
Justice and there hatched seven young birds. A Serpent gliding
past the nest from its hole in the wall ate up the young
unfledged nestlings. The Swallow, finding her nest empty,
lamented greatly and exclaimed: &quot;Woe to me a stranger! that
in this place where all others' rights are protected, I
alone should suffer wrong.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A84">84. The Thief and His Mother</h3>

<p>A BOY stole a lesson-book from one of his schoolfellows and
took it home to his Mother. She not only abstained from beating
him, but encouraged him. He next time stole a cloak and brought
it to her, and she again commended him. The Youth, advanced to
adulthood, proceeded to steal things of still greater value. At
last he was caught in the very act, and having his hands bound
behind him, was led away to the place of public execution. His
Mother followed in the crowd and violently beat her breast in
sorrow, whereupon the young man said, &quot;I wish to say
something to my Mother in her ear.&quot; She came close to him,
and he quickly seized her ear with his teeth and bit it off. The
Mother upbraided him as an unnatural child, whereon he replied,
&quot;Ah! if you had beaten me when I first stole and brought to
you that lesson-book, I should not have come to this, nor have
been thus led to a disgraceful death.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A85">85. The Old Man and Death</h3>

<p>AN OLD MAN was employed in cutting wood in the forest, and, in
carrying the faggots to the city for sale one day, became very
wearied with his long journey. He sat down by the wayside, and
throwing down his load, besought &quot;Death&quot; to come.
&quot;Death&quot; immediately appeared in answer to his summons
and asked for what reason he had called him. The Old Man
hurriedly replied, &quot;That, lifting up the load, you may place
it again upon my shoulders.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A86">86. The Fir-Tree and the Bramble</h3>

<p>A FIR-TREE said boastingly to the Bramble, &quot;You are
useful for nothing at all; while I am everywhere used for roofs
and houses.&quot; The Bramble answered: &quot;You poor creature,
if you would only call to mind the axes and saws which are about
to hew you down, you would have reason to wish that you had grown
up a Bramble, not a Fir-Tree.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Better poverty without care, than

<hr>

<h3 id="A87">87. The Mouse, the Frog, and the Hawk</h3>

<p>A MOUSE who always lived on the land, by an unlucky chance
formed an intimate acquaintance with a Frog, who lived for the
most part in the water. The Frog, one day intent on mischief,
bound the foot of the Mouse tightly to his own. Thus joined
together, the Frog first of all led his friend the Mouse to the
meadow where they were accustomed to find their food. After this,
he gradually led him towards the pool in which he lived, until
reaching the very brink, he suddenly jumped in, dragging the
Mouse with him. The Frog enjoyed the water amazingly, and swam
croaking about, as if he had done a good deed. The unhappy Mouse
was soon suffocated by the water, and his dead body floated about
on the surface, tied to the foot of the Frog. A Hawk observed it,
and, pouncing upon it with his talons, carried it aloft. The Frog,
being still fastened to the leg of the Mouse, was also carried
off a prisoner, and was eaten by the Hawk.</p>

<h3 id="A88">88. The Man Bitten by a Dog</h3>

<p>A MAN who had been bitten by a Dog went about in quest of
someone who might heal him. A friend, meeting him and learning
what he wanted, said, &quot;If you would be cured, take a piece
of bread, and dip it in the blood from your wound, and go and
give it to the Dog that bit you.&quot; The Man who had been
bitten laughed at this advice and said, &quot;Why? If I should do
so, it would be as if I should beg every Dog in the town to bite
me.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Benefits bestowed upon the evil-disposed
increase their means of injuring you.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A89">89. The Two Pots</h3>

<p>A RIVER carried down in its stream two Pots, one made of
earthenware and the other of brass. The Earthen Pot said to the
Brass Pot, &quot;Pray keep at a distance and do not come near me,
for if you touch me ever so slightly, I shall be broken in pieces,
and besides, I by no means wish to come near you.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Equals make the best friends.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A90">90. The Wolf and the Sheep</h3>

<p>A WOLF, sorely wounded and bitten by dogs, lay sick and maimed
in his lair. Being in want of food, he called to a Sheep who was
passing, and asked him to fetch some water from a stream flowing
close beside him. &quot;For,&quot; he said, &quot;if you will
bring me drink, I will find means to provide myself with meat.&quot;
&quot;Yes,&quot; said the Sheep, &quot;if I should bring you the
draught, you would doubtless make me provide the meat also.&quot;
</p>

<p class="reditalic">Hypocritical speeches are easily seen
through.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A91">91. The &AElig;thiop</h3>

<p>THE PURCHASER of a black servant was persuaded that the color
of his skin arose from dirt contracted through the neglect of his
former masters. On bringing him home he resorted to every means
of cleaning, and subjected the man to incessant scrubbings. The
servant caught a severe cold, but he never changed his color or
complexion.</p>

<p class="reditalic">What's bred in the bone will
stick to the flesh.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A92">92. The Fisherman and His Nets</h3>

<p>A FISHERMAN, engaged in his calling, made a very successful
cast and captured a great haul of fish. He managed by a skillful
handling of his net to retain all the large fish and to draw them
to the shore; but he could not prevent the smaller fish from
falling back through the meshes of the net into the sea.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A93">93. The Huntsman and the Fisherman</h3>

<p>A HUNTSMAN, returning with his dogs from the field, fell in by
chance with a Fisherman who was bringing home a basket well laden
with fish. The Huntsman wished to have the fish, and their owner
experienced an equal longing for the contents of the game- bag.
They quickly agreed to exchange the produce of their day's
sport. Each was so well pleased with his bargain that they made
for some time the same exchange day after day. Finally a neighbor
said to them, &quot;If you go on in this way, you will soon
destroy by frequent use the pleasure of your exchange, and each
will again wish to retain the fruits of his own sport.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Abstain and enjoy.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A94">94. The Old Woman and the Wine-Jar</h3>

<p>AN OLD WOMAN found an empty jar which had lately been full of
prime old wine and which still retained the fragrant smell of its
former contents. She greedily placed it several times to her nose,
and drawing it backwards and forwards said, &quot;O most
delicious! How nice must the Wine itself have been, when it
leaves behind in the very vessel which contained it so sweet a
perfume!&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">The memory of a good deed lives.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A95">95. The Fox and the Crow</h3>

<p>A CROW having stolen a bit of meat, perched in a tree and held
it in her beak. A Fox, seeing this, longed to possess the meat
himself, and by a wily stratagem succeeded. &quot;How handsome is
the Crow,&quot; he exclaimed, in the beauty of her shape and in
the fairness of her complexion! Oh, if her voice were only equal
to her beauty, she would deservedly be considered the Queen of
Birds!&quot; This he said deceitfully; but the Crow, anxious to
refute the reflection cast upon her voice, set up a loud caw and
dropped the flesh. The Fox quickly picked it up, and thus
addressed the Crow: &quot;My good Crow, your voice is right
enough, but your wit is wanting.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A96">96. The Two Dogs</h3>

<p>A MAN had two dogs: a Hound, trained to assist him in his
sports, and a Housedog, taught to watch the house. When he
returned home after a good day's sport, he always gave the
Housedog a large share of his spoil. The Hound, feeling much
aggrieved at this, reproached his companion, saying, &quot;It is
very hard to have all this labor, while you, who do not assist in
the chase, luxuriate on the fruits of my exertions.&quot; The
Housedog replied, &quot;Do not blame me, my friend, but find
fault with the master, who has not taught me to labor, but to
depend for subsistence on the labor of others.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Children are not to be blamed for the
faults of their parents.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A97">97. The Stag in the Ox-Stall</h3>

<p>A STAG, roundly chased by the hounds and blinded by fear to
the danger he was running into, took shelter in a farmyard and
hid himself in a shed among the oxen. An Ox gave him this kindly
warning: &quot;O unhappy creature! why should you thus, of your
own accord, incur destruction and trust yourself in the house of
your enemy?&quot; The Stag replied: &quot;Only allow me, friend,
to stay where I am, and I will undertake to find some favorable
opportunity of effecting my escape.&quot;<br>
At the approach of the evening the herdsman came to feed his
cattle, but did not see the Stag; and even the farm-bailiff with
several laborers passed through the shed and failed to notice him.
The Stag, congratulating himself on his safety, began to express
his sincere thanks to the Oxen who had kindly helped him in the
hour of need. One of them again answered him: &quot;We indeed
wish you well, but the danger is not over. There is one other yet
to pass through the shed, who has as it were a hundred eyes, and
until he has come and gone, your life is still in peril.&quot; At
that moment the master himself entered, and having had to
complain that his oxen had not been properly fed, he went up to
their racks and cried out: &quot;Why is there such a scarcity of
fodder? There is not half enough straw for them to lie on. Those
lazy fellows have not even swept the cobwebs away.&quot; While he
thus examined everything in turn, he spied the tips of the
antlers of the Stag peeping out of the straw. Then summoning his
laborers, he ordered that the Stag should be seized and killed.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A98">98. The Hawk, the Kite, and the Pigeons</h3>

<p>THE PIGEONS, terrified by the appearance of a Kite, called
upon the Hawk to defend them. He at once consented. When they had
admitted him into the cote, they found that he made more havoc
and slew a larger number of them in one day than the Kite could
pounce upon in a whole year.</p>

<p class="reditalic">Avoid a remedy that is worse than the
disease.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A99">99. The Widow and the Sheep</h3>

<p>A CERTAIN poor widow had one solitary Sheep. At shearing time,
wishing to take his fleece and to avoid expense, she sheared him
herself, but used the shears so unskillfully that with the fleece
she sheared the flesh. The Sheep, writhing with pain, said,
&quot;Why do you hurt me so, Mistress? What weight can my blood
add to the wool? If you want my flesh, there is the butcher, who
will kill me in an instant; but if you want my fleece and wool,
there is the shearer, who will shear and not hurt me.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">The least outlay is not always the
greatest gain.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A100">100. The Wild Ass and the Lion</h3>

<p>A WILD ASS and a Lion entered into an alliance so that they
might capture the beasts of the forest with greater ease. The
Lion agreed to assist the Wild Ass with his strength, while the
Wild Ass gave the Lion the benefit of his greater speed. When
they had taken as many beasts as their necessities required, the
Lion undertook to distribute the prey, and for this purpose
divided it into three shares. &quot;I will take the first share,&quot;
he said, &quot;because I am King: and the second share, as a
partner with you in the chase: and the third share (believe me)
will be a source of great evil to you, unless you willingly
resign it to me, and set off as fast as you can.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Might makes right.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A101">101. The Eagle and the Arrow</h3>

<p>AN EAGLE sat on a lofty rock, watching the movements of a Hare
whom he sought to make his prey. An archer, who saw the Eagle
from a place of concealment, took an accurate aim and wounded him
mortally. The Eagle gave one look at the arrow that had entered
his heart and saw in that single glance that its feathers had
been furnished by himself. &quot;It is a double grief to me,&quot;
he exclaimed, &quot;that I should perish by an arrow feathered
from my own wings.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A102">102. The Sick Kite</h3>

<p>A KITE, sick unto death, said to his mother: &quot;O Mother!
do not mourn, but at once invoke the gods that my life may be
prolonged.&quot; She replied, &quot;Alas! my son, which of the
gods do you think will pity you? Is there one whom you have not
outraged by filching from their very altars a part of the
sacrifice offered up to them?&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">We must make friends in prosperity if
we would have their help in adversity.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A103">103. The Lion and the Dolphin</h3>

<p>A LION roaming by the seashore saw a Dolphin lift up its head
out of the waves, and suggested that they contract an alliance,
saying that of all the animals they ought to be the best friends,
since the one was the king of beasts on the earth, and the other
was the sovereign ruler of all the inhabitants of the ocean. The
Dolphin gladly consented to this request. Not long afterwards the
Lion had a combat with a wild bull, and called on the Dolphin to
help him. The Dolphin, though quite willing to give him
assistance, was unable to do so, as he could not by any means
reach the land. The Lion abused him as a traitor. The Dolphin
replied, &quot;Nay, my friend, blame not me, but Nature, which,
while giving me the sovereignty of the sea, has quite denied me
the power of living upon the land.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A104">104. The Lion and the Boar</h3>

<p>ON A SUMMER DAY, when the great heat induced a general thirst
among the beasts, a Lion and a Boar came at the same moment to a
small well to drink. They fiercely disputed which of them should
drink first, and were soon engaged in the agonies of a mortal
combat. When they stopped suddenly to catch their breath for a
fiercer renewal of the fight, they saw some Vultures waiting in
the distance to feast on the one that should fall first. They at
once made up their quarrel, saying, &quot;It is better for us to
make friends, than to become the food of Crows or Vultures.&quot;
</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A105">105. The One-Eyed Doe</h3>

<p>A DOE blind in one eye was accustomed to graze as near to the
edge of the cliff as she possibly could, in the hope of securing
her greater safety. She turned her sound eye towards the land
that she might get the earliest tidings of the approach of hunter
or hound, and her injured eye towards the sea, from whence she
entertained no anticipation of danger. Some boatmen sailing by
saw her, and taking a successful aim, mortally wounded her.
Yielding up her last breath, she gasped forth this lament: &quot;O
wretched creature that I am! to take such precaution against the
land, and after all to find this seashore, to which I had come
for safety, so much more perilous.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A106">106. The Shepherd and the Sea</h3>

<p>A SHEPHERD, keeping watch over his sheep near the shore, saw
the Sea very calm and smooth, and longed to make a voyage with a
view to commerce. He sold all his flock, invested it in a cargo
of dates, and set sail. But a very great tempest came on, and the
ship being in danger of sinking, he threw all his merchandise
overboard, and barely escaped with his life in the empty ship.
Not long afterwards when someone passed by and observed the
unruffled calm of the Sea, he interrupted him and said, &quot;It
is again in want of dates, and therefore looks quiet.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A107">107. The Ass, the Cock, and the Lion</h3>

<p>AN ASS and a Cock were in a straw-yard together when a Lion,
desperate from hunger, approached the spot. He was about to
spring upon the Ass, when the Cock (to the sound of whose voice
the Lion, it is said, has a singular aversion) crowed loudly, and
the Lion fled away as fast as he could. The Ass, observing his
trepidation at the mere crowing of a Cock summoned courage to
attack him, and galloped after him for that purpose. He had run
no long distance, when the Lion, turning about, seized him and
tore him to pieces.</p>

<p class="reditalic">False confidence often leads into
danger.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A108">108. The Mice and the Weasels</h3>

<p>THE WEASELS and the Mice waged a perpetual war with each other,
in which much blood was shed. The Weasels were always the victors.
The Mice thought that the cause of their frequent defeats was
that they had no leaders set apart from the general army to
command them, and that they were exposed to dangers from lack of
discipline. They therefore chose as leaders Mice that were most
renowned for their family descent, strength, and counsel, as well
as those most noted for their courage in the fight, so that they
might be better marshaled in battle array and formed into troops,
regiments, and battalions. When all this was done, and the army
disciplined, and the herald Mouse had duly proclaimed war by
challenging the Weasels, the newly chosen generals bound their
heads with straws, that they might be more conspicuous to all
their troops. Scarcely had the battle begun, when a great rout
overwhelmed the Mice, who scampered off as fast as they could to
their holes. The generals, not being able to get in on account of
the ornaments on their heads, were all captured and eaten by the
Weasels.</p>

<p class="reditalic">The more honor the more danger.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A109">109. The Mice in Council</h3>

<p>THE MICE summoned a council to decide how they might best
devise means of warning themselves of the approach of their great
enemy the Cat. Among the many plans suggested, the one that found
most favor was the proposal to tie a bell to the neck of the Cat,
so that the Mice, being warned by the sound of the tinkling,
might run away and hide themselves in their holes at his approach.
But when the Mice further debated who among them should thus
&quot;bell the Cat,&quot; there was no one found to do it.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A110">110. The Wolf and the Housedog</h3>

<p>A WOLF, meeting a big well-fed Mastiff with a wooden collar
about his neck asked him who it was that fed him so well and yet
compelled him to drag that heavy log about wherever he went.
&quot;The master,&quot; he replied. Then said the Wolf: &quot;May
no friend of mine ever be in such a plight; for the weight of
this chain is enough to spoil the appetite.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A111">111. The Rivers and the Sea</h3>

<p>THE RIVERS joined together to complain to the Sea, saying,
&quot;Why is it that when we flow into your tides so potable and
sweet, you work in us such a change, and make us salty and unfit
to drink?&quot; The Sea, perceiving that they intended to throw
the blame on him, said, &quot;Pray cease to flow into me, and
then you will not be made briny.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A112">112. The Playful Ass</h3>

<p>AN ASS climbed up to the roof of a building, and frisking
about there, broke in the tiling. The owner went up after him and
quickly drove him down, beating him severely with a thick wooden
cudgel. The Ass said, &quot;Why, I saw the Monkey do this very
thing yesterday, and you all laughed heartily, as if it afforded
you very great amusement.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A113">113. The Three Tradesmen</h3>

<p>A GREAT CITY was besieged, and its inhabitants were called
together to consider the best means of protecting it from the
enemy. A Bricklayer earnestly recommended bricks as affording the
best material for an effective resistance. A Carpenter, with
equal enthusiasm, proposed timber as a preferable method of
defense. Upon which a Currier stood up and said, &quot;Sirs, I
differ from you altogether: there is no material for resistance
equal to a covering of hides; and nothing so good as leather.&quot;
</p>

<p class="reditalic">Every man for himself.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A114">114. The Master and His Dogs</h3>

<p>A CERTAIN MAN, detained by a storm in his country house, first
of all killed his sheep, and then his goats, for the maintenance
of his household. The storm still continuing, he was obliged to
slaughter his yoke oxen for food. On seeing this, his Dogs took
counsel together, and said, &quot;It is time for us to be off,
for if the master spare not his oxen, who work for his gain, how
can we expect him to spare us?&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">He is not to be trusted as a friend
who mistreats his own family.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A115">115. The Wolf and the Shepherds</h3>

<p>A WOLF, passing by, saw some Shepherds in a hut eating a
haunch of mutton for their dinner. Approaching them, he said,
&quot;What a clamor you would raise if I were to do as you are
doing!&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A116">116. The Dolphins, the Whales, and the Sprat</h3>

<p>THE DOLPHINS and Whales waged a fierce war with each other.
When the battle was at its height, a Sprat lifted its head out of
the waves and said that he would reconcile their differences if
they would accept him as an umpire. One of the Dolphins replied,
&quot;We would far rather be destroyed in our battle with each
other than admit any interference from you in our affairs.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A117">117. The Ass Carrying the Image</h3>

<p>AN ASS once carried through the streets of a city a famous
wooden Image, to be placed in one of its Temples. As he passed
along, the crowd made lowly prostration before the Image. The Ass,
thinking that they bowed their heads in token of respect for
himself, bristled up with pride, gave himself airs, and refused
to move another step. The driver, seeing him thus stop, laid his
whip lustily about his shoulders and said, &quot;O you perverse
dull-head! it is not yet come to this, that men pay worship to an
Ass.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">They are not wise who give to
themselves the credit due to others.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A118">118. The Two Travelers and the Axe</h3>

<p>TWO MEN were journeying together. One of them picked up an axe
that lay upon the path, and said, &quot;I have found an axe.&quot;
&quot;Nay, my friend,&quot; replied the other, &quot;do not say
'I,' but 'We' have found an axe.&quot; They
had not gone far before they saw the owner of the axe pursuing
them, and he who had picked up the axe said, &quot;We are undone.&quot;
&quot;Nay,&quot; replied the other, &quot;keep to your first mode
of speech, my friend; what you thought right then, think right
now. Say 'I,' not 'We' are undone.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">He who shares the danger ought to
share the prize.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A119">119. The Old Lion</h3>

<p>A LION, worn out with years and powerless from disease, lay on
the ground at the point of death. A Boar rushed upon him, and
avenged with a stroke of his tusks a long-remembered injury.
Shortly afterwards the Bull with his horns gored him as if he
were an enemy. When the Ass saw that the huge beast could be
assailed with impunity, he let drive at his forehead with his
heels. The expiring Lion said, &quot;I have reluctantly brooked
the insults of the brave, but to be compelled to endure such
treatment from thee, a disgrace to Nature, is indeed to die a
double death.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A120">120. The Old Hound</h3>

<p>A HOUND, who in the days of his youth and strength had never
yielded to any beast of the forest, encountered in his old age a
boar in the chase. He seized him boldly by the ear, but could not
retain his hold because of the decay of his teeth, so that the
boar escaped. His master, quickly coming up, was very much
disappointed, and fiercely abused the dog. The Hound looked up
and said, &quot;It was not my fault, master: my spirit was as
good as ever, but I could not help my infirmities. I rather
deserve to be praised for what I have been, than to be blamed for
what I am.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A121">121. The Bee and Jupiter</h3>

<p>A BEE from Mount Hymettus, the queen of the hive, ascended to
Olympus to present Jupiter some honey fresh from her combs.
Jupiter, delighted with the offering of honey, promised to give
whatever she should ask. She therefore besought him, saying,
&quot;Give me, I pray thee, a sting, that if any mortal shall
approach to take my honey, I may kill him.&quot; Jupiter was much
displeased, for he loved the race of man, but could not refuse
the request because of his promise. He thus answered the Bee:
&quot;You shall have your request, but it will be at the peril of
your own life. For if you use your sting, it shall remain in the
wound you make, and then you will die from the loss of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Evil wishes, like chickens, come home
to roost.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A122">122. The Milk-Woman and Her Pail</h3>

<p>A FARMER'S daughter was carrying her Pail of milk from
the field to the farmhouse, when she fell a-musing. &quot;The
money for which this milk will be sold, will buy at least three
hundred eggs. The eggs, allowing for all mishaps, will produce
two hundred and fifty chickens. The chickens will become ready
for the market when poultry will fetch the highest price, so that
by the end of the year I shall have money enough from my share to
buy a new gown. In this dress I will go to the Christmas parties,
where all the young fellows will propose to me, but I will toss
my head and refuse them every one.&quot; At this moment she
tossed her head in unison with her thoughts, when down fell the
milk pail to the ground, and all her imaginary schemes perished
in a moment.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A123">123. The Seaside Travelers</h3>

<p>SOME TRAVELERS, journeying along the seashore, climbed to the
summit of a tall cliff, and looking over the sea, saw in the
distance what they thought was a large ship. They waited in the
hope of seeing it enter the harbor, but as the object on which
they looked was driven nearer to shore by the wind, they found
that it could at the most be a small boat, and not a ship. When
however it reached the beach, they discovered that it was only a
large faggot of sticks, and one of them said to his companions,
&quot;We have waited for no purpose, for after all there is
nothing to see but a load of wood.&quot;</p>

<h3 id="A124">124. The Brazier and His Dog</h3>

<p>A BRAZIER had a little Dog, which was a great favorite with
his master, and his constant companion. While he hammered away at
his metals the Dog slept; but when, on the other hand, he went to
dinner and began to eat, the Dog woke up and wagged his tail, as
if he would ask for a share of his meal. His master one day,
pretending to be angry and shaking his stick at him, said, &quot;You
wretched little sluggard! what shall I do to you? While I am
hammering on the anvil, you sleep on the mat; and when I begin to
eat after my toil, you wake up and wag your tail for food. Do you
not know that labor is the source of every blessing, and that
none but those who work are entitled to eat?&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A125">125. The Ass and His Shadow</h3>

<p>A TRAVELER hired an Ass to convey him to a distant place. The
day being intensely hot, and the sun shining in its strength, the
Traveler stopped to rest, and sought shelter from the heat under
the Shadow of the Ass. As this afforded only protection for one,
and as the Traveler and the owner of the Ass both claimed it, a
violent dispute arose between them as to which of them had the
right to the Shadow. The owner maintained that he had let the Ass
only, and not his Shadow. The Traveler asserted that he had, with
the hire of the Ass, hired his Shadow also. The quarrel proceeded
from words to blows, and while the men fought, the Ass galloped
off.</p>

<p class="reditalic">In quarreling about the shadow we
often lose the substance.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A126">126. The Ass and His Masters</h3>

<p>AN ASS, belonging to an herb-seller who gave him too little
food and too much work made a petition to Jupiter to be released
from his present service and provided with another master.
Jupiter, after warning him that he would repent his request,
caused him to be sold to a tile-maker. Shortly afterwards,
finding that he had heavier loads to carry and harder work in the
brick-field, he petitioned for another change of master. Jupiter,
telling him that it would be the last time that he could grant
his request, ordained that he be sold to a tanner. The Ass found
that he had fallen into worse hands, and noting his master's
occupation, said, groaning: &quot;It would have been better for
me to have been either starved by the one, or to have been
overworked by the other of my former masters, than to have been
bought by my present owner, who will even after I am dead tan my
hide, and make me useful to him.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A127">127. The Oak and the Reeds</h3>

<p>A VERY LARGE OAK was uprooted by the wind and thrown across a
stream. It fell among some Reeds, which it thus addressed: &quot;I
wonder how you, who are so light and weak, are not entirely
crushed by these strong winds.&quot; They replied, &quot;You
fight and contend with the wind, and consequently you are
destroyed; while we on the contrary bend before the least breath
of air, and therefore remain unbroken, and escape.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Stoop to conquer.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A128">128. The Fisherman and the Little Fish</h3>

<p>A FISHERMAN who lived on the produce of his nets, one day
caught a single small Fish as the result of his day's labor.
The Fish, panting convulsively, thus entreated for his life:
&quot;O Sir, what good can I be to you, and how little am I worth?
I am not yet come to my full size. Pray spare my life, and put me
back into the sea. I shall soon become a large fish fit for the
tables of the rich, and then you can catch me again, and make a
handsome profit of me.&quot; The Fisherman replied, &quot;I
should indeed be a very simple fellow if, for the chance of a
greater uncertain profit, I were to forego my present certain
gain.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A129">129. The Hunter and the Woodsman</h3>

<p>A HUNTER, not very bold, was searching for the tracks of a
Lion. He asked a man felling oaks in the forest if he had seen
any marks of his footsteps or knew where his lair was. &quot;I
will,&quot; said the man, &quot;at once show you the Lion himself.&quot;
The Hunter, turning very pale and chattering with his teeth from
fear, replied, &quot;No, thank you. I did not ask that; it is his
track only I am in search of, not the Lion himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">The hero is brave in deeds as well as
words.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A130">130. The Wild Boar and the Fox</h3>

<p>A WILD BOAR stood under a tree and rubbed his tusks against
the trunk. A Fox passing by asked him why he thus sharpened his
teeth when there was no danger threatening from either huntsman
or hound. He replied, &quot;I do it advisedly; for it would never
do to have to sharpen my weapons just at the time I ought to be
using them.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A131">131. The Lion in a Farmyard</h3>

<p>A LION entered a farmyard. The Farmer, wishing to catch him,
shut the gate. When the Lion found that he could not escape, he
flew upon the sheep and killed them, and then attacked the oxen.
The Farmer, beginning to be alarmed for his own safety, opened
the gate and released the Lion. On his departure the Farmer
grievously lamented the destruction of his sheep and oxen, but
his wife, who had been a spectator to all that took place, said,
&quot;On my word, you are rightly served, for how could you for a
moment think of shutting up a Lion along with you in your
farmyard when you know that you shake in your shoes if you only
hear his roar at a distance?&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A132">132. Mercury and the Sculptor</h3>

<p>MERCURY ONCE DETERMINED to learn in what esteem he was held
among mortals. For this purpose he assumed the character of a man
and visited in this disguise a Sculptor's studio having
looked at various statues, he demanded the price of two figures
of Jupiter and Juno. When the sum at which they were valued was
named, he pointed to a figure of himself, saying to the Sculptor,
&quot;You will certainly want much more for this, as it is the
statue of the Messenger of the Gods, and author of all your gain.&quot;
The Sculptor replied, &quot;Well, if you will buy these, I'll
fling you that into the bargain.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A133">133. The Swan and the Goose</h3>

<p>A CERTAIN rich man bought in the market a Goose and a Swan. He
fed the one for his table and kept the other for the sake of its
song. When the time came for killing the Goose, the cook went to
get him at night, when it was dark, and he was not able to
distinguish one bird from the other. By mistake he caught the
Swan instead of the Goose. The Swan, threatened with death, burst
forth into song and thus made himself known by his voice, and
preserved his life by his melody.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A134">134. The Swollen Fox</h3>

<p>A VERY HUNGRY FOX, seeing some bread and meat left by
shepherds in the hollow of an oak, crept into the hole and made a
hearty meal. When he finished, he was so full that he was not
able to get out, and began to groan and lament his fate. Another
Fox passing by heard his cries, and coming up, inquired the cause
of his complaining. On learning what had happened, he said to him,
&quot;Ah, you will have to remain there, my friend, until you
become such as you were when you crept in, and then you will
easily get out.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A135">135. The Fox and the Woodcutter</h3>

<p>A FOX, running before the hounds, came across a Woodcutter
felling an oak and begged him to show him a safe hiding-place.
The Woodcutter advised him to take shelter in his own hut, so the
Fox crept in and hid himself in a corner. The huntsman soon came
up with his hounds and inquired of the Woodcutter if he had seen
the Fox. He declared that he had not seen him, and yet pointed,
all the time he was speaking, to the hut where the Fox lay hidden.
The huntsman took no notice of the signs, but believing his word,
hastened forward in the chase. As soon as they were well away,
the Fox departed without taking any notice of the Woodcutter:
whereon he called to him and reproached him, saying, &quot;You
ungrateful fellow, you owe your life to me, and yet you leave me
without a word of thanks.&quot; The Fox replied, &quot;Indeed, I
should have thanked you fervently if your deeds had been as good
as your words, and if your hands had not been traitors to your
speech.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A136">136. The Birdcatcher, the Partridge, and the
Cock</h3>

<p>A BIRDCATCHER was about to sit down to a dinner of herbs when
a friend unexpectedly came in. The bird-trap was quite empty, as
he had caught nothing, and he had to kill a pied Partridge, which
he had tamed for a decoy. The bird entreated earnestly for his
life: &quot;What would you do without me when next you spread
your nets? Who would chirp you to sleep, or call for you the
covey of answering birds?&quot; The Birdcatcher spared his life,
and determined to pick out a fine young Cock just attaining to
his comb. But the Cock expostulated in piteous tones from his
perch: &quot;If you kill me, who will announce to you the
appearance of the dawn? Who will wake you to your daily tasks or
tell you when it is time to visit the bird-trap in the morning?&quot;
He replied, &quot;What you say is true. You are a capital bird at
telling the time of day. But my friend and I must have our
dinners.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Necessity knows no law.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A137">137. The Monkey and the Fishermen</h3>

<p>A MONKEY perched upon a lofty tree saw some Fishermen casting
their nets into a river, and narrowly watched their proceedings.
The Fishermen after a while gave up fishing, and on going home to
dinner left their nets upon the bank. The Monkey, who is the most
imitative of animals, descended from the treetop and endeavored
to do as they had done. Having handled the net, he threw it into
the river, but became tangled in the meshes and drowned. With his
last breath he said to himself, &quot;I am rightly served; for
what business had I who had never handled a net to try and catch
fish?&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A138">138. The Flea and the Wrestler</h3>

<p>A FLEA settled upon the bare foot of a Wrestler and bit him,
causing the man to call loudly upon Hercules for help. When the
Flea a second time hopped upon his foot, he groaned and said,
&quot;O Hercules! if you will not help me against a Flea, how can
I hope for your assistance against greater antagonists?&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A139">139. The Two Frogs</h3>

<p>TWO FROGS dwelt in the same pool. When the pool dried up under
the summer's heat, they left it and set out together for
another home. As they went along they chanced to pass a deep well,
amply supplied with water, and when they saw it, one of the Frogs
said to the other, &quot;Let us descend and make our abode in
this well: it will furnish us with shelter and food.&quot; The
other replied with greater caution, &quot;But suppose the water
should fail us. How can we get out again from so great a depth?&quot;
</p>

<p class="reditalic">Do nothing without a regard to the

<hr>

<h3 id="A140">140. The Cat and the Mice</h3>

<p>A CERTAIN HOUSE was overrun with Mice. A Cat, discovering this,
made her way into it and began to catch and eat them one by one.
Fearing for their lives, the Mice kept themselves close in their
holes. The Cat was no longer able to get at them and perceived
that she must tempt them forth by some device. For this purpose
she jumped upon a peg, and suspending herself from it, pretended
to be dead. One of the Mice, peeping stealthily out, saw her and
said, &quot;Ah, my good madam, even though you should turn into a
meal-bag, we will not come near you.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A141">141. The Lion, the Bear, and the Fox</h3>

<p>A LION and a Bear seized a Kid at the same moment, and fought
fiercely for its possession. When they had fearfully lacerated
each other and were faint from the long combat, they lay down
exhausted with fatigue. A Fox, who had gone round them at a
distance several times, saw them both stretched on the ground
with the Kid lying untouched in the middle. He ran in between
them, and seizing the Kid scampered off as fast as he could. The
Lion and the Bear saw him, but not being able to get up, said,
&quot;Woe be to us, that we should have fought and belabored
ourselves only to serve the turn of a Fox.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">It sometimes happens that one man has
all the toil, and another all the profit.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A142">142. The Doe and the Lion</h3>

<p>A DOE hard pressed by hunters sought refuge in a cave
belonging to a Lion. The Lion concealed himself on seeing her
approach, but when she was safe within the cave, sprang upon her
and tore her to pieces. &quot;Woe is me,&quot; exclaimed the Doe,
&quot;who have escaped from man, only to throw myself into the
mouth of a wild beast?&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">In avoiding one evil, care must be
taken not to fall into another.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A143">143. The Farmer and the Fox</h3>

<p>A FARMER, who bore a grudge against a Fox for robbing his
poultry yard, caught him at last, and being determined to take an
ample revenge, tied some rope well soaked in oil to his tail, and
set it on fire. The Fox by a strange fatality rushed to the
fields of the Farmer who had captured him. It was the time of the
wheat harvest; but the Farmer reaped nothing that year and
returned home grieving sorely.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A144">144. The Seagull and the Kite</h3>

<p>A SEAGULL having bolted down too large a fish, burst its deep
gullet-bag and lay down on the shore to die. A Kite saw him and
exclaimed: &quot;You richly deserve your fate; for a bird of the
air has no business to seek its food from the sea.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Every man should be content to mind
his own business.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A145">145. The Philosopher, the Ants, and Mercury</h3>

<p>A PHILOSOPHER witnessed from the shore the shipwreck of a
vessel, of which the crew and passengers were all drowned. He
inveighed against the injustice of Providence, which would for
the sake of one criminal perchance sailing in the ship allow so
many innocent persons to perish. As he was indulging in these
reflections, he found himself surrounded by a whole army of Ants,
near whose nest he was standing. One of them climbed up and stung
him, and he immediately trampled them all to death with his foot.
Mercury presented himself, and striking the Philosopher with his
wand, said, &quot;And are you indeed to make yourself a judge of
the dealings of Providence, who hast thyself in a similar manner
treated these poor Ants?&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A146">146. The Mouse and the Bull</h3>

<p>A BULL was bitten by a Mouse and, angered by the wound, tried
to capture him. But the Mouse reached his hole in safety. Though
the Bull dug into the walls with his horns, he tired before he
could rout out the Mouse, and crouching down, went to sleep
outside the hole. The Mouse peeped out, crept furtively up his
flank, and again biting him, retreated to his hole. The Bull
rising up, and not knowing what to do, was sadly perplexed. At
which the Mouse said, &quot;The great do not always prevail.
There are times when the small and lowly are the strongest to do
mischief.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A147">147. The Lion and the Hare</h3>

<p>A LION came across a Hare, who was fast asleep. He was just in
the act of seizing her, when a fine young Hart trotted by, and he
left the Hare to follow him. The Hare, scared by the noise, awoke
and scudded away. The Lion was unable after a long chase to catch
the Hart, and returned to feed upon the Hare. On finding that the
Hare also had run off, he said, &quot;I am rightly served, for
having let go of the food that I had in my hand for the chance of
obtaining more.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A148">148. The Peasant and the Eagle</h3>

<p>A PEASANT found an Eagle captured in a trap, and much admiring
the bird, set him free. The Eagle did not prove ungrateful to his
deliverer, for seeing the Peasant sitting under a wall which was
not safe, he flew toward him and with his talons snatched a
bundle from his head. When the Peasant rose in pursuit, the Eagle
let the bundle fall again. Taking it up, the man returned to the
same place, to find that the wall under which he had been sitting
had fallen to pieces; and he marveled at the service rendered him
by the Eagle.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A149">149. The Image of Mercury and the Carpenter</h3>

<p>A VERY POOR MAN, a Carpenter by trade, had a wooden image of
Mercury, before which he made offerings day by day, and begged
the idol to make him rich, but in spite of his entreaties he
became poorer and poorer. At last, being very angry, he took his
image down from its pedestal and dashed it against the wall. When
its head was knocked off, out came a stream of gold, which the
Carpenter quickly picked up and said, &quot;Well, I think thou
art altogether contradictory and unreasonable; for when I paid
you honor, I reaped no benefits: but now that I maltreat you I am
loaded with an abundance of riches.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A150">150. The Bull and the Goat</h3>

<p>A BULL, escaping from a Lion, hid in a cave which some
shepherds had recently occupied. As soon as he entered, a He-
Goat left in the cave sharply attacked him with his horns. The
Bull quietly addressed him: &quot;Butt away as much as you will.
I have no fear of you, but of the Lion. Let that monster go away
and I will soon let you know what is the respective strength of a
Goat and a Bull.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">It shows an evil disposition to take
advantage of a friend in distress.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A151">151. The Dancing Monkeys</h3>

<p>A PRINCE had some Monkeys trained to dance. Being naturally
great mimics of men's actions, they showed themselves most
apt pupils, and when arrayed in their rich clothes and masks,
they danced as well as any of the courtiers. The spectacle was
often repeated with great applause, till on one occasion a
courtier, bent on mischief, took from his pocket a handful of
nuts and threw them upon the stage. The Monkeys at the sight of
the nuts forgot their dancing and became (as indeed they were)
Monkeys instead of actors. Pulling off their masks and tearing
their robes, they fought with one another for the nuts. The
dancing spectacle thus came to an end amidst the laughter and
ridicule of the audience.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A152">152. The Fox and the Leopard</h3>

<p>THE FOX and the Leopard disputed which was the more beautiful
of the two. The Leopard exhibited one by one the various spots
which decorated his skin. But the Fox, interrupting him, said,
&quot;And how much more beautiful than you am I, who am decorated,
not in body, but in mind.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A153">153. The Monkeys and Their Mother</h3>

<p>THE MONKEY, it is said, has two young ones at each birth. The
Mother fondles one and nurtures it with the greatest affection
and care, but hates and neglects the other. It happened once that
the young one which was caressed and loved was smothered by the
too great affection of the Mother, while the despised one was
nurtured and reared in spite of the neglect to which it was
exposed.</p>

<p class="reditalic">The best intentions will not always
ensure success.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A154">154. The Oaks and Jupiter</h3>

<p>THE OAKS presented a complaint to Jupiter, saying, &quot;We
bear for no purpose the burden of life, as of all the trees that
grow we are the most continually in peril of the axe.&quot;
Jupiter made answer: &quot;You have only to thank yourselves for
the misfortunes to which you are exposed: for if you did not make
such excellent pillars and posts, and prove yourselves so
serviceable to the carpenters and the farmers, the axe would not
so frequently be laid to your roots.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A155">155. The Hare and the Hound</h3>

<p>A HOUND started a Hare from his lair, but after a long run,
gave up the chase. A goat-herd seeing him stop, mocked him,
saying &quot;The little one is the best runner of the two.&quot;
The Hound replied, &quot;You do not see the difference between us:
I was only running for a dinner, but he for his life.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A156">156. The Traveler and Fortune</h3>

<p>A TRAVELER wearied from a long journey lay down, overcome with
fatigue, on the very brink of a deep well. Just as he was about
to fall into the water, Dame Fortune, it is said, appeared to him
and waking him from his slumber thus addressed him: &quot;Good
Sir, pray wake up: for if you fall into the well, the blame will
be thrown on me, and I shall get an ill name among mortals; for I
find that men are sure to impute their calamities to me, however
much by their own folly they have really brought them on
themselves.&quot;</p>

<p class="reditalic">Everyone is more or less master of
his own fate.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A157">157. The Bald Knight</h3>

<p>A BALD KNIGHT, who wore a wig, went out to hunt. A sudden puff
of wind blew off his hat and wig, at which a loud laugh rang
forth from his companions. He pulled up his horse, and with great
glee joined in the joke by saying, &quot;What a marvel it is that
hairs which are not mine should fly from me, when they have
forsaken even the man on whose head they grew.&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A158">158. The Shepherd and the Dog</h3>

<p>A SHEPHERD penning his sheep in the fold for the night was
about to shut up a wolf with them, when his Dog perceiving the
wolf said, &quot;Master, how can you expect the sheep to be safe
if you admit a wolf into the fold?&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A159">159. The Lamp</h3>

<p>A LAMP, soaked with too much oil and flaring brightly, boasted
that it gave more light than the sun. Then a sudden puff of wind
arose, and the Lamp was immediately extinguished. Its owner lit
it again, and said: &quot;Boast no more, but henceforth be
content to give thy light in silence. Know that not even the
stars need to be relit&quot;</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="A160">160. The Lion, the Fox, and the Ass</h3>

<p>THE LION, the Fox and the Ass entered into an agreement to
assist each other in the chase. Having secured a large booty, the
Lion on their return from the forest asked the Ass to allot his
due portion to each of the three partners in the treaty. The Ass
carefully divided the spoil into three equal shares and modestly
requested the two others to make the first choice. The Lion,
bursting out into a great rage, devoured the Ass. Then he
requested the Fox to do him the favor to make a division. The Fox
accumulated all that they had killed into one large heap and left
to himself the smallest possible morsel. The Lion said, &quot;Who
has taught you, my very excellent fellow, the art of division?
You are perfect to a fraction.&quot; He replied, &quot;I learned
it from the Ass, by witnessing his fate.&quot;</p>
