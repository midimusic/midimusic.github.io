<P>
The first catalog of Mozart's work was compiled by Sir Ludwig von K&ouml;chel
and published in 1862. It listed all works known at the time in chronological
order and is now known as K<SUP>1</SUP>.
<P>
The second edition, K<SUP>2</SUP> of the catalog with minor corrections and additions was
 prepared by Count Paul von Waldersee and published in 1905.
<P>
The first thorough revision K<SUP>3</SUP> was completed by Alfred Einstein in 1936. He had to
insert some new numbers between the previously established numbers, so he added lower
case letters.
<P>
K<SUP>3</SUP> was reprinted in 1946 with an extensive supplement of corrections and additions. It
was known as K<SUP>3a</SUP>.
<P>
The fourth and fifth editions were unchanged reprints of K<SUP>3</SUP>.
<P>
The sixth and current edition, K<SUP>6</SUP>, published in 1964, continued Einstein's innovations
and added even more numbers with lower case letters appended and a few with upper
case letters as well.
<P>
Seventh and eighth editions are unchanged reprints of K<SUP>6</SUP>.
<P>
This explains why many of Mozart's works bear two K numbers and a few three, such as
the Symphony in B-Flat major, K182=K166c=K173dA.
<P>
<B>Abbreviations:</B><BR>

strings = 2 violins, viola, basso<BR>
deest = a work by (or attributed to) Mozart which does not appear in any edition of the K&ouml;chel Catalog.<BR>
Anh. = Anhang or appendix.
