<h2>Midimusic eplayOrgan</h2>
<h3>A fully featured playable Multiple Pipe Organ Simulator and Translator</h3>
EplayOrgan is a multi purpose sample based pipe organ simulator intended to be playable by organists and
versatile enough to be useful to everybody with an interest in organs. It will translate, play and record
organ midi files for most organs in real time. It will load and be playable almost instantly and does not
need an expensive computer with huge amounts of memory.<br>
I have given it its own page <a href="eplayOrgan.html">eplayOrgan</a>
<h2>Wurlitzer and Estey e-roll Player for Mac</h2>
<h3>Plays all Wurlitzer and Estey e-rolls (MacOS Only, 64 bits)</h3>
<a href = "eplaymacpkgV3.5a.zip"> Download eplaymacpkgV3.5a.zip</a> Installs and works OK with MacOS, including the latest, Catalina.<br>
Updated 25 November 2019. Installation instructions improved.<br>
(Note: A Mac folder must be zipped/unzipped by the Mac zipper or the file attributes will be damaged.)
<p>
<h2>Midimusic eplayWin32</h2>
<h3>Estey and Wurlitzer e-roll player for Hauptwerk, Miditzer,<br>Viscount, Allen, GrandOrgue &amp; eplayOrgan</h3>
eplayWin32 has been replaced by eplayOrgan which can now play these e-rolls direct.<br>
eplayWin32 is still available below if you need it.
<h4>Version 4.0a Now Available for download</h4>
<IMG id="david" SRC="eplayWin32.png" ALT="eplayWin32">
This graphical player will play Estey e-rolls on any Hauptwerk, Miditzer, Viscount or Allen organ and Wurlitzer Band Organ
e-rolls on eplayOrgan (Windows, iMac and Linux)<br>
It will automatically operate the manuals, pedals, stops, couplers and swell.
<p>
It is optimised for playing multiple organs simultaneously. You can run two or more
copies of eplayWin32 and when you tell one to "play" all copies will start playing together.
<p>
Version 3.2 and later have an improved algorithm for activating the stops on w165 organs - all previous versions made errors when
w165 stops were simultaneously opened and cancelled, particularly noticeable on the later rolls when played on eplayOrgan
(on which you can see precisely what is happening). Version 4.0a still includes all of the previous features. It has been
compiled with the latest minGW32 compiler, has improved and additional organ data and plays Hauptwerk Burea Church organ
using Lars Palo/Graham Goode's sound font.
<p>
You can drag and drop your Estey or Wurlitzer e-roll files on to eplayWin32 and it will immediately play them.
<p>
It plays almost any organ which can be played from midi keyboards, including Hauptwerk, Miditzer, GrandOrgue, Viscount, Allen, jOrgan and eplayOrgan.<br>
Organs included (already set up): eplayOrgan. See <a href="eplayOrgan.html">eplayOrgan</a> multi purpose organ.<br>
Miditzer 160, 216 and 260 cinema organs<br>
Wurlitzer 125, 150 and 165 band organs<br>
Hauptwerk St Anne's Mosely, Burea Church, Paramount 310<br>
Estey Church Organ<br>
Viscount Classic 3500<br>
Allen Church and Theatre organs<br>
Grand Orgue Barton 3-7, Burea Church, Demo V1, Pitea School of Music<br>
More organs can be easily added. All the organ data is stored in an easily edited .xml file.
<p>
Version 4.0 and later include a new playlist feature for each organ. You can play multiple files one after the other without any breaks or attention.
<p>
I have included the usual Windows Installer option in the zip, this will automatically install eplayWin32.<br>
Alternatively eplayWin32 will work just as well if you manually install it by copying it and its supporting files to any folder on your PC.
It will even work from a memory stick. For your convenience I have included a folder with all of the files in the downloadable zip.
<p>
<a href = "setup_eplayWin32V4_0a.zip"> Download setup_eplayWin32V4_0a.zip</a> The Latest Version.<br>
If you play Wurlitzer 165 eRolls or Allen organs this version is a necessary update.<br>
If you want to use eplayWin32 on a Mac this version is a necessary update.<br>
Version 4.0a will install and run just the same on an iMac and Linux as it does on Windows. 64 bit systems preferred
but will also work just as well on 32 bit systems.
