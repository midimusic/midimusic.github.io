<h2>Mills Violano Virtuoso Tracker Bar Data</h2>
<h4>Author: David Back, May 2015 - Updated April/May/June/October 2024.</h4>
This data was collected from various sources.
It has been tested by correctly playing violano e-rolls.<br>
Violano e-rolls have no midi offset.
<h3>Roll</h3>
14.25" wide with holes splaced 0.11428"
<h3>Tuning</h3>
Tuning A = 435Hz, the Factory Standard.

<b>NOTES:</b><br>
<b>1.</b>  Staccato: This is a very brief signal to terminate the currently playing violin notes from the start of this signal
and for the duration of this signal. (While applied it lifts the bow wheels from the strings).
<p>
<b>2.</b>  Tremolo: This has to be turned on in short bursts as otherwise it will weaken the paper roll. Many of the later rolls
do not use it at all. Usually it is permanently engaged by users.
<p>
<b>3.</b> Violin bowing default: There are 5 levels of bowing speed 1..5. The default speed is level 3.<br>
Note selection and bowing both begin and end at the same time unless staccato is applied.<br>
More than one level is often simultaneously applied - either by design or error.<br>
Experimentally:<br>
If slow and very slow are on simultaneously, very slow overrides slow.<br>
If fast and very fast are on simultaneously, very fast overrides fast.<br>
If slow and fast are on simultaneously the speed is very slightly faster than all speed controls off.
<p>
<b>4.</b> Rosin relay: Early Violanos automatically applied rosin on rewind.<br>
For later models, rosin was liberally applied while playing when signalled by the rosin relay.<br>
At about roll 2800 and later, the rosin relay applied rosin before playing each tune.
<p>
<b>5.</b>  Piano Accent and Piano Mute: Used in early violanos only. Piano accent is active on and off all the time an early roll is playing
and is believed to be the early implementation of the sustain pedal. Piano Mute is just a brief signal which is assumed turns the
piano off. Neither are used in rolls after about roll 1950.
<p>
<b>6.</b> Piano Loud and Piano Soft:<br>
(Very Early violanos only) Piano loud activates a relay which applies maximum current to the piano note magnets.
Piano soft bypassed some of the magnet current and produced a softer note. When neither is activated a medium current is
applied (the default). It is doubtful if this method was ever successful.
<p>
(Hammer Rail Control) The Hammer Rail solenoid (58) moves the hammer rail to the loud position or
Hammer Rail solenoid (44) moves the hammer rail to the soft position. If present, Hammer rail solenoid (122) moves the hammer rail to the
very soft position. The hammer rail stays in the position it has been moved to until moved again. Rolls generally set the hammer rail to
the loud position at the end of a tune. The very soft position is very rarely (if ever) used.
