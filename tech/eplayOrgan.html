<h2>EplayOrgan</h2>
<h4>Author: David Back, November 2017 to September 2024<br></h4>
<h3>EplayOrgan, Multi Purpose Translating Virtual Pipe Organ</h3>
<h4>64bit Versions 6.0.4 and 32bit Version 4.2.3-2 plus Portable Versions 6.0.1X and Version 3.1.0.0 all available for download</h4>
EplayOrgan is a multi purpose sample based virtual pipe organ with microtonal capability. It is intended to be played by organists and
is versatile enough to be useful to everybody with an interest in organs. It will translate, play and record
organ midi files for most organs in real time. It will load and be playable almost instantly and does not
need an expensive computer with huge amounts of memory.

This organ was designed and tested on a 64 bit Windows 10 system but was always intended
to be portable and versatile in that it will run on any 32 or 64 bit Windows system from Windows XP to Windows 11.
It will also run on any Mac or Linux system under Wine. You can run Windows on any Mac (using Bootcamp) and eplayOrgan runs perfectly. Latency is negligable under Windows.
<p>
A "Portable App" version of eplayOrgan is available, eplayOrganPortable. This also runs on any Windows system
or any Mac or Linux system under Wine.

<h3>Main Features</h3>
<ol>
<li>Easy and quick to install.</li>
<li>All included organs are fully set up, just connect one or more midi keyboards and a touch screen monitor, select your organ and begin playing. The correct midi channels are automatically set up for each organ.</li>
<li>Optionally version 5.0.0 and onwards can also be set up to play from any standard organ console which has a midi output. This makes the playing options more versatile and is similar to other popular organs. However, as with the other organs, each organ you wish to play has to be individually set up.</li>
<li>The keys, stops, pistons and two swell indicators are all fully animated and their state is easily visible.</li>
<li>Optional Second Touch is available on all organs. See the second touch keys move to show exactly what is happening</li>
<li>Optionally velocity sensitive on every rank. Useful for piano ranks.</li>
<li>All stops are coloured and may be "swiped" open or closed, Manuals have a fully chromatic "swipe".</li>
<li>The stops have automatically selected font sizes, varying with display size which makes them easy to read.</li>
<li>Coupled keys move to show their state.</li>
<li>See the Wurlitzer Band Organ keys and stops moving for the first time ever.</li>

</ol>
<p>
This organ is perfect for translating organ midi files to play properly on other organs, no other organ can do this.<br>
See: <a href="./convert.html">Organ Midi File Translation</a> for details. New organs can be imported and existing organs exported.
<p>
All <b>Hauptwerk</b> midi file formats are supported. Stops may be selected using midi nrpn or sysex events.<br>
Master couplers may be used. All will be recorded and played, as appropriate, in midi files.
<p>
All <b>GrandOrgue</b> organs are supported via loadable settings files. See below.
You can download and run GrandOrgue free from github. It will run on Windows, Mac or some Linux systems.
There are many free samplesets available, some of these may be converted to .sf2 format (using Polyphone) to play on eplayOrgan64.<br>

<h4>DOWNLOADS: eplayOrgan and eplayOrganPortable are completely free to download and to use.</h4>

MD5 0b53eeb19d98a026ff361635e35e06c2<br>
A 64 bit version of eplayOrgan with a Windows Installer which can use very large .sf2 and .sf3 soundfonts and give sound quality comparable with Grand Orgue and Hauptwerk.
<p>
For user convenience, the display of version 6.0.0 and onwards is divided into three seperate
panels. The stops are located on two panels, left and right while the main central
display with pistons, midi player and other controls remains as before. Each
panel can be located and sized to suit the user's convenience. Font sizes on
the stop panels are automatically adjusted to suit the sizes of the panels.

A 64 bit version of eplayOrgan with a Windows Installer which can use very large .sf2 and .sf3 soundfonts and give sound quality comparable with Grand Orgue and Hauptwerk.
<p>
Version 5.0.0 and onwards can optionally be set up to play from any standard organ console which has a midi output. This makes the playing options more versatile and is similar to other popular organs.
<p>
Versions 4.2.4 and later can be microtonally tuned to any temperament using standard real time and/or non real time midi sysex or AnaMark .TUN text files.<br>
They can record midi tuning files and also automatically record and play midi files with the correct temperament. This is unique to eplayOrgan64.<br>
The universal organ sound font is tuned to A=440 equal tempered and is within a tolerance of +-2 cents.<br>
It has improved polyphony and speeds up processing by making better use of the cpu's multiple cores.

It contains my purpose designed organ sound font with the best free note and release samples I can find. This font is now used in all organs. V4.2.2 has many improvements
including better graphics and a re-designed menu system to improve playability. It plays MuseScore midi files at the correct tempo. Ideal for music composers.

<h4>Installing and using Portable Apps</h4>
The Portable App installer decompresses the eplayOrganPortable files and copies them into a folder of your choosing. To install two
copies of eplayOrganPortable simply run the installer again and copy the files into a different folder.<br>
You can install eplayOrganPortable on to a memory stick and you can then plug this stick into any computer and run it from the stick.<br>
When you unplug the stick nothing on the computer will have been changed (unless you have purposely saved some eplayOrgan midi files
on that computer).<br>
You can also install eplayOrganPortable into a "cloud" folder and it will run from there.
<p>
To install eplayOrganPortable on Mac or Linux computers, first install Wine, then install eplayOrganPortable into a folder on drive Z: (The other drives
will be hidden and inconvenient to use.)<br>
Alternatively or additionally, if Wine is installed you can just plug in a memory stick made for Windows, as above and the organ will run when you double
click the .exe file.
<p>
Note: The Portable Apps Platform works properly only on Windows computers.

<h3>Settings files for GrandOrgue</h3>
<h4>Import these settings files into your GrandOrgue organ to gain support as indicated.</h4>
Use eplayOrgan to drive the GO organ or use eplayOrgan to record midi files for playing on GO.<br>
These settings files are easy to make. See: <a href="./convert.html">Organ Midi File Translation</a> for details.<br>
<p>
If you use eplayOrgan to make midi files to play on GO - you must load one of the settings files below, or a similar file,
to tell the GO midi player how to set stops and swell pedals.<br>
Note: The Barton's Snare Drum is much too loud; reduce it's Gain from 22 to 6db for the best results.
